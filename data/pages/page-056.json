The figure is dried out like leather left too long in the sun, but it is standing, moving, attacking. Its grip is cold as winter ice. Giovanni struggles, vision darkening. All around them, more figures are rising - corpses dragging themselves upright from doorways, from the ground, from shadows. Their eyes glow like poisoned stars. Whispers fill the air.",
