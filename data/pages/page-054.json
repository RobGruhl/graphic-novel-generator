Runes carved and painted across his massive frame seem to glow. The stroke that follows is a butchering - cleaving a bandit in two with terrible, practiced efficiency. Remaining bandits flee into the darkness, their courage broken by this single, terrible display. Behind him, the iron skull at his belt glows with faint witch-fire.",
