The fortress walls sag and flow like honey. People flee in all directions, screaming, burning with cold purple fire. Geometries that hurt to perceive fold through impossible tessellations. The entire island seems to collapse inward.",

The purple rift swallows everything - fortress, village, bog, forest. Where the island stood, only blackened stone will remain. His massive form hunches over the oars, rowing south through the night.",
