His priest's robes are spattered with blood, his face a mask of holy purpose. Beside him, Sadia's blade cleaves through a cultist's spear and then through the cultist himself. Behind them, one of the drummers begins to transform - fur sprouting from his skin, jaw distending into a muzzle.",

      "visual": "Isaac stands near the entrance, his hands raised high, complex patterns of light weaving between his fingers. Pure, brilliant, painful light floods the chamber like the wrath of heaven itself - washing over the bone walls, the screaming cultists, the battling warriors. The cultists howl and writhe, covering their eyes. Nizack staggers, blinded. Even the heroes are caught in the brilliance. The contrast of holy light against the cathedral of death is absolute.",
