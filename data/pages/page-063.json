Among the vines stand statues of impossible forms, hewn from stone of colors no quarry ever produced, glittering with mineral inclusions that defy naming. They are watching. On the walls, alien writing covers every surface - script from no human civilization. At the far end, an altar. Behind it, a cyclopean figure with a single eye socket that drinks the light. The scale is overwhelming, ancient, profane.",
