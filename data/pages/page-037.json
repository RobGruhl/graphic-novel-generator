The floor is carpeted with bones - elongated skulls, wrong ribcages, vertebrae that suggest spines which bend in impossible directions. At the chamber's heart, the Nagini waits - wearing a woman's shape like a glove, dark hair coiling without wind, skin moonlight-pale with scales rippling beneath, golden eyes with vertical pupils. Lueduo falls to his knees before her, his body refusing to support him in her presence. The air itself seems to thicken around her divine horror.",
