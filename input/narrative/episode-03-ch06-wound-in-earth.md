# Episode III: To the Kurgan
## Chapter Six: A Wound in the Earth

The howling stopped sometime in the deepest watches of the night.

One moment the keening filled the darkness, accompanied by the rhythmic thunder of drums—and then a new sound rose above it: a horrific scream, as if someone were having their skin peeled from their flesh. Then silence. Complete and absolute.

Dog, who had been snarling and bristling, stood from his crouch and looked up at Gan. She calmed him with a touch. Dog wagged his tail, less anxious now, the immediate threat having passed.

In the chaos of the psychic assault, the horses had panicked and broken their leads, scattering into the steppe. None of them slept after that. They kept their weapons close and watched the darkness until the blood-red rays of dawn crept across the steppe.

"We walk from here," Sadia said grimly. "No matter how this ends."

They threaded down the ravine as the morning mist burned away, forded the river where the water ran cold and fast over smooth stones, and ascended the far bank. The land beyond was flat and featureless, grass rippling in winds that carried the smell of old death.

Bansi and Giovanni crept forward while the others waited with the horses, moving low through the grass until the kurgan loomed before them through the dissipating mist.

The first thing they saw was a pole. A flayed skin hung chained to it.

Everything was silent. Through the thinning mist, more poles became visible—more skins, more horror. The burial mound rose behind them like a wound in the earth, its slopes scarred by excavation.

They signaled the others forward.

The company circled the perimeter, counting the dead. The skins on the poles had been flayed with terrible precision, the tattoos on the flayed hides still visible. Earmack gasped and pointed to one near the top.

"This was not one of my companions." Her voice was hollow. "The tattoos—these are their own people."

Sadia's jaw tightened. "So they sacrificed one of their own."

At the base of the kurgan, open cages sat empty. Gnawed human bones littered the ground, scattered like offerings before an altar.

Something shimmered at the top of the mound.

"There," Gan said, pointing. "At the summit. Do you see it?"

Sadia drew her blade and began to march up the slope. Giovanni and Gan followed, weapons ready. The others came behind, stepping carefully over the scattered bones.

The excavation was worse than it had appeared from below. Shafts had been dug into the kurgan's heart, the remains of ancient chests broken open and scattered. Whatever treasures the burial mound had held were gone—looted not by grave robbers seeking gold, but by the cult seeking darker prizes.

And at the center of the devastation, the shimmering thing revealed itself.

It was a portal—a tear in the fabric of the world, its edges rippling like heat haze over desert sand. Through it, they could see... a library. Scrolls and codices. An astrolabe by a window.

Abu-Rayhan's house.

"How?" Sadia breathed.

But the library was ransacked. Even through the portal, they could see the devastation—shelves overturned, scrolls scattered, furniture smashed.

Earmack's face had gone pale. "Last night," she whispered, "I think she must have seen inside my mind."

The realization hit them like a physical blow. Karishkir's psychic assault had not merely been an attack—it had been reconnaissance. She had torn through Earmack's memories, learned of Abu-Rayhan's house, learned where the amulet was kept.

And while they had been writhing on the steppe, fighting visions and bleeding from their noses, she had struck.

*"Portals,"* Leif whispered. *"Someone has been tearing holes between places. The fabric here is weak, brother. Tread carefully."*

"We go through," Eskil said, his voice flat. He did not wait for agreement. Weapons drawn, he stepped into the shimmer—

—and tumbled out into the library.

The others followed: Giovanni, then Gan, Sadia, Bansi, and finally Lüèduó. The transition was disorienting—stepping up and then suddenly sideways, as if the laws of gravity had been suspended.

They emerged into nightmare.

In the doorway to the courtyard, an outstretched hand lay on the ground. The arm was severed from the body, which lay further back—one of Abu-Rayhan's servants, rent and torn to pieces. The courtyard beyond was littered with more bodies, the household staff butchered where they had tried to flee.

The doors to the outside were barred shut. Bodies lay before them—the attack had come from within.

Lüèduó led the search, moving through the ransacked rooms with his javelin ready. The sleeping chambers had been torn apart, bedding shredded, furniture smashed. No bodies in the servants' quarters.

The master chamber's door had been blown inward, reduced to splinters by some terrible force. Inside, amid similar devastation, lay the body of a young woman. She wore the tattoos and dress of a steppe nomad—one of Karishkir's people.

A lute had been smashed into her skull. And protruding from her throat, driven through with killing precision, was Rahzalahn's silver hair comb.

"She fought back," Bansi said quietly. "She killed one of them."

Bansi rolled the body, plunged her silver dagger into its heart—just to be certain—and Sadia cut off its head.

From the front of the house came pounding on the door—not the frantic hammering of an attack, but the urgent knock of someone seeking entry.

"Is anyone there?" A woman's voice. Hind.

They unbarred the door to find Hind, Abu-Rayhan, and a stranger—a thin man with the look of a scholar, his robes marked with symbols Giovanni did not recognize but found oddly familiar.

The man introduced himself, "I am Isaac, a friend to Abu-Rayhan and a fellow scholar. He has told me of your difficulties." He turned ashen as he surveyed the courtyard. He stepped back, drawing wards of protection in the air, his face falling to dread.

Abu-Rayhan took one look at the carnage and dashed toward his chambers. They heard his anguished cry moments later.

"The amulet is gone!" He wept, cataloging the dead of his house, sobs wracking his hunched form. The second sin, almost as grievous, the loss of knowledge from the destruction of rare books and tomes.

After securing the grounds and reconnoitering in the main hall Giovanni noticed another shimmer in a darkened corner of the ceiling. Something deeper than shadow. Another portal, smaller than the first, opening onto blackness that smelled of earth and old stone.

"There," he said, pointing. "Another way."

The stranger stepped forward. "I serve the Order of Hermes. With the wards here we had thought ourselves safe from such intrusions." He studied the portal with practiced eyes. "Those are the catacombs beneath the city. Ancient tunnels, older than Merv itself."

"You know of the amulet?" Lüèduó asked.

Isaac nodded slowly. "It is ancient. From the sands of Egypt, but older—far older. The builders of the black cities beneath the sands created such things. With an amulet like this, one can conjure things from other parts of the cosmos. Open doors that should remain closed."

Eskil felt a twinge in his wards and caught his breath.

Hind stepped forward, her face hard with determination. "We must have that amulet. And Rahzalahn. She is my responsibility—my people." Her dark eyes swept across the company. "If you bring me this, the treasure is yours. All of it."

Lüèduó looked at the portal, then back at the others. "We should not linger and lose the chance to pass through the portal."

Sadia, for once without sarcasm, nodded her approval. "Well said. What are we waiting for?"

Bansi was already climbing, using the broken furniture to reach the ceiling. The portal accepted her strangely—she went up, then suddenly sideways, and vanished into darkness. A moment later, a rope dropped down.

One by one, they climbed into darkness.

---

The catacombs were ancient beyond reckoning—tunnels carved from living rock, their walls bearing inscriptions in languages that predated Arabic, predated Persian, a rolling scrawl chiseled in slashing script.

Dust lay thick on the floor, and in it they could read the story of what had passed: footprints of boots and bare feet, the larger prints of paws, and here and there the marks of something being dragged—or someone kicking and thrashing to get free.

Gan dropped to one knee, studying the tracks. "There was a struggle. Someone fighting to escape."

Rahzalahn. It had to be.

The tracks split where the passage forked. Bansi studied the dust and the arrangement of the stones—some slightly raised, positioned too perfectly.

"The floor is trapped," she whispered. "Stay to the sides."

They pressed against the walls, edging past the trigger stones. From somewhere ahead came a soft click, and darts hissed from hidden ports in the walls—but they passed through empty air, finding no targets.

The passage widened into a chamber where skeletons hung chained in alcoves, their bones yellowed with age. The tracks split again here, some going left, some right. They chose to stay together and went left.

Gan spotted more raised stones ahead. Earmack was edging past one of the skeletal alcoves when something exploded out of the niche—a blur of fur and fangs that seized her before she could scream.

The werewolf's claws dug into Earmack's shoulders as it bore her to the ground. Bansi was there in an instant, driving two silver weapons into the beast's arms with all her strength. The werewolf howled and released its grip, staggering backward—directly into the wall trap.

A spike jutted from the stone with a sound like breaking bone, impaling the creature through the chest. Its fur receded, its features settling into those of a young man as death claimed him.

But Earmack...

Gan caught her as she fell. The wounds were deep—too deep. Blood bubbled at the girl's lips as she tried to speak, but only a wet gurgle emerged.

Giovanni knelt beside her, his hand finding hers. He began the last rites—words in Latin that none of the others understood, but the solemnity of his voice needed no translation. Earmack's eyes found his, and something like peace settled over her features as the prayers washed over her.

She died holding his hand.

Sadia stood over them, her face unreadable. When Giovanni finished, she knelt and dipped her blade in the pool of Earmack's blood.

"For luck," she said quietly. "And for Rahzalahn."

They left Earmack's body where it lay—there was no time for burial, and the girl would have understood. She had been a warrior of the steppes. Her spirit would find its own way home.

They continued on.

---

The curve of the passage brought them to a stone staircase stretching up into blackness and descending into deeper darkness. Drums reverberated from the stone, echoing up the corridor.

Eskil saw movement from a side passage to their right—something loping through the shadows with inhuman speed. He pulled his war blade and stepped to meet it.

The werewolf leaped through the air, claws extended, jaws gaping. Eskil's blade sang three times in quick succession—two cuts, then a final stroke that sent the creature's head spinning into the darkness. He did not even break stride.

From up the stairs, two figures appeared—human in form but moving with the coiled tension of predators. They charged down toward the company.

The woman hurled an axe at Eskil. It whistled past his head and clanged against the wall behind him.

Gan drew and loosed in one fluid motion. Her flaming arrow struck the woman in the chest, and Isaac stepped forward, his hands moving in arcane patterns. Her human form melted as she reverted to her more bestial form screaming as fire from the arrow spread, engulfing the creature, and she thrashed and fell, burning.

Lüèduó jammed his spear into the other attacker as he rushed past. Sadia was there a heartbeat later, her blade opening the man's throat. He staggered, thrashed, and collapsed, before sprouting fur and fangs, half transformed back into wolfen form.

Gan's falcon circled at the top of the stairs, crying out as it found a door.

They climbed, keeping to the walls. Strange symbols had been painted on the stone in what looked like blood—sigils and designs that hurt to look at directly.

Behind them, Eskil heard a sound. He turned to find the werewolf Sadia had killed struggling to rise, its throat already knitting back together.

His blade descended. The head rolled free, and this time the body stayed down after he skewered the heart.

At the top of the stairs, an iron grate barred their way. Through its bars, they could see a vast chamber beyond—figures moving, drums pounding, red light flickering across walls of bone.

Eskil pushed through the others, seized the grate with both hands, and heaved. His muscles rippled beneath his scarred skin, his feet planted, his body straining against the ancient iron. With a great cry, he flung the grate upward.

It crashed into a recess in the ceiling and he held it in place as the others passed through, finally ducking under and dropping it closed behind them.

They poured into the bone chapel.
