# Prologue III: The Consort of Shub-Niggurath

In the Year of Our Lord 900, on the storm-wracked island of Saaremaa, there stood the ruins of what was once called Eysýsla. A burned fortress, its stones still blackened by unnatural fire. The scattered remains of a village that should never have prospered in that bleak corner where Baltic storms hammered the coast and forests grew dark.

Yet for centuries, Eysýsla had thrived. There had always been dancing there. Since the Gods knew when, and long before. First on stony heaths, then at camps before humble tents, and finally in the great halls. To the sound of shawm and fiddle. The dance pavilion was built in the center of the village, among stones that would later form the foundation of the fortress. In time the festivities moved into the Undercroft, constructed as both sepulcher and altar, expanded over generations—burrowing deep into the earth with corridors and crypts, secret chambers and secluded places for rituals that predated the Christ.

Bards and minstrels from Denmark and Kieev would come and perform. Eysýsla was renowned among those who knew. Everyone in the village served the Undercroft in some capacity.

They danced five nights each week in the Undercroft. A wedding feast on Wednesday, raiders returning triumphant on Thursday, jigs and reels on Fridays, the common folk setting aside their labors on Saturday evening. Even the silver-haired elders had a dedicated night for formal dance. Carts brought folk from the countryside, from nearby Kärla, Kaarma, and Kihelkonna. The ride was always free. Along the way people would drink, quarrel, and gossip. Those who grew too unruly were left roadside. Long after midnight the carts would return.

The girls sat together and spoke of work, boys, and music. They exchanged messages with drovers, from other girls who were also traveling to the dance. They fixed their shawls and mended their dresses, placing combs or piling curls high. Watching the boys.

*Did you invite anyone?*

He was comely enough, but he came with his friends. That one is pleasing to look upon.

*'He is the miller's son,'* says Sofie. *'Dull as stone, but pleasant to the eye. He will end up working in his father's mill, covered in flour and spending his evenings at the tavern. What an idyllic life.'*

*'Why must everyone make sport of me because I live in Valjala?'* Laughter and pushing. Alexandra must escape the countryside.

*'It is not as though you will meet any learned men in Kaarma.'*

*'It is not as though there are any learned men in Kaarma.'*

*'It is not as though you care.'*

*'It is all about timing,'* Elin explains. *'Right now I shall flirt with comely boys. When I am ready to bear children, I will let the elders arrange my match, and meet him beneath the maypole.'* Laughter and more taunts. *'Or I will make certain to conceive with one of the raiders, then marry one of the miller's dull sons. Someone with a good house, a warm hearth, and coin set aside.'* More laughter and boasting. Elin from Lümanda is well-regarded.

A message passed from Kari: *'Fine piece of meat climbing all over me. Could be something.'* Lenny from Kärla says: *'Nothing but drunk lads here. And myself.'* More laughter. The buzz of more voices as the lanes begin to throng. The noise has doubled as they clear the woods. The girls laugh louder and grow more vulgar. The boys simply shout.

They are greeted by the smell of vomit and horse dung. The staging area is chaos—carts, animals, and people everywhere. Dusk falls. The air is thick with the scent of bodies, yeast, and honeysuckle.

The girls gather at the entrance. They kiss each other's cheeks and remark upon clothes. Skirts and sashes, stockings if the evening is cold. Long fingernails, despite their impracticality, are fashionable. Jewelry depicting serpents. A drum and fiddle boom from within the vault. Men walking past stare at them. Kari points out Meat standing alone nearby. Good-looking, dark hair, pale blue eyes and large, towering over the boys and taller than the rest of the men, perhaps twenty-one or twenty-two winters. Sturdy boots on his feet, braided metal at his neck. A white shirt with simple black trousers.

*'Is he a stranger?'*

*'No, from Mustjala.'*

*'Do people truly live there?'*

*'I doubt it.'*

*'Why is he alone?'* Anna is wary. Men on their own in the Undercroft can mean trouble. Maniacs, madmen, hill people from the outer hills.

*'He is meeting his companions here.'*

*'Team?'*

*'Toga-honk.'*

*'Is he well-known?'*

*'Perhaps in Mustjala. He plays once a week with his friends.'*

Anna looks at Meat and smiles warmly. *'Does he know any signs?'* *'How should I know?'* says Kari and waves at him. He smiles back, stooping his 6'8" form to clear the lintel, his eyes flashing not unattractive.

Anna sighs. *'He will suffice for now. Let us go in.'*

---

The dance is alive in the Undercroft. As it has been for ages beyond counting. Boys and girls strutting. Leaping and prancing and displaying themselves. Drinking and staggering about. Just as their parents once did. Sometimes you see someone who can truly dance.

The girls claim their territory at the bar near a small dancing area. One floor up. Separated from the worst of the rabble. They sit, stand, and dance, scattered evenly across the space. They own that bar. Anna sits drinking wine in the finest chair. Like a jarl's wife upon a throne. Short braids, white blouse, and chalk-stripe vest. No one troubles Anna from Pihtla. She looks out over the dance floor. Elin and Lenni are dancing with each other. Kari and Meat are sitting at the bar. Meat is describing Toga-Honk, the brutal primitive tug-of-war. Sofie sips some juice and surveys the place. Sun-streaked Alexandra and a few of the younger girls sit at the table behind Anna's. Alexandra tells tales and the girls listen with rapt attention. Especially little Nalim and Emma from Leisi, who have not been here before.

*'This is what the girls do,'* says Alexandra. Observe and learn. Where to sit, where to stand. Alexandra lays down the law. We own this place.

*'This is all you need. You will command it.'*

*'What do we tell our parents?'*

*'Nothing.'*

*'So this is where to come?'*

*'It is the finest place. Go deeper in, you will see.'*

Alexandra explains the dangers. Kari is standing beside Meat now. Feel-his-breath-close. Soon they will kiss. It is only a matter of time until he falls into the snare. Elin and Lenni hold each other close on the floor. Treating the boys to a display, frightening them with long tongue kisses and hands beneath tops. The barkeep looks away, blushing. The fiddler speeds up, his bow shrieking, the drum following. Hip-rolling music. People stare and breathe heavily.

Anna takes a gulp of wine and gazes at the world through the bottom of the bottle. It almost looks more normal that way. As though a distorted mirror made everything appear right. She closes her eyes, lets everything spin. She thinks about the daughters, of daughters, of daughters of serpents. About eons of light. About forests of slowly swaying limbs. Tentacles thick as tree trunks. About death. Her dreams these days are visions from beyond the veil. Sofie sits beside her.

*'Meat seems acceptable.'*

*'No companions?'*

*'He greeted a few people but they keep their distance. He spoke with that stranger over there for a time.'* She indicates a foreigner with dark, curling hair sitting alone at a table.

*'Comely,'* Anna murmurs.

*'Indeed. But our friend Meat desires to be left alone with his new companion.'*

*'Anything else?'*

*'He ruts with swine, has carbuncles, gout and running sores,'* Sofie snickers. He was honestly the most impressive physical specimen present.

Anna ignores her. Sofie grimaces. Haughty manners. But she understands. The girls want healthy meat. No defects, no diseases.

Anna nods. All appears well. The girls cast sidelong glances her way. All the others are watching Elin and Lenni.

*'Well then,'* Anna says. *'Come, you Thousand Young.'*

---

They whisper together. Sofie embraces her tightly. Like dearest friends. The queens of the Undercroft. Sofie walks past Meat and nods.

Kari nibbles Meat's lower lip. Mid-sentence, as he speaks of hand placement and knot strength. He freezes and all the girls steal glances. Holding their breath. Then he responds with much tongue. The girls exhale. Quick looks say: *'It is working.'*

*'Prepare yourselves.'*

Meat fumbles with his mug of ale. Sets it down behind him and grasps Kari's backside instead. They have a lengthy embrace, leaning against the bar. Anna closes her eyes, sees primeval swamps behind her eyelids. Swamps and rain and kisses. The sound of flutes and drums float up from below, as something ancient and primal is played by the musicians.

Sofie looks about. She is thinking about the trials ahead. In this final season before full initiation, the Elder Mothers test them in many ways: calculating by the star-wheel, reading omens in crop growth, understanding the sacred cycles. And of course, the bog itself—the ultimate trial that transforms apprentice to priestess.

Sofie circles the dance floor. A girl of perhaps eighteen winters, not tall, with frizzy blonde hair, a black peasant skirt, and simple homespun blouse. Nobody remarkable. But Sofie sees everything. Like a hawk. Look there: Elin and Lenni have gone to the bar and stand a few paces behind Meat. Alexandra and the younger girls swarm around the bar as well. Alexandra offers them all the sukarek. Special preparation. Small black lumps that taste of earth and bitterness. Very rare stuff.

Once Sofie treated some fool's dog to a generous portion. That evening the village was full of whispers about what had happened to the beast. Those who understood kept silent.

The drums and flutes grow more chaotic. More people dancing. From where Sofie stands you can hardly see Meat for all the girls surrounding him. They circle him like a school of fish. Concealing him from his companions. Sofie has observed three men who likely know him. They sit at some distance, laughing over their ale.

*'Some men have all the fortune.'*

*'We shall not see him again this night.'*

They do not see Alexandra lacing Meat's ale. They do not see Kari's hands working inside Meat's clothes. Unfastening his belt. Delving into his trousers. The air is thick in the center of the swarm of girls. The girls pretend to look elsewhere yet they know. They watch from the corners of their eyes and whisper details. Hear the boy's breathing. Kari is bold.

Once her initiation is complete she will work her own fishing boat, previously abandoned by her missing father, adrift and empty, floating in the harbor.

She licks her palm. Spits into it. Then her hand disappears inside Meat's trousers. While she kisses him like a serpent.

Anna nods at Sofie. Midnight approaches. *'Get them moving.'*

Sofie confirms the older girls are in position. She nods at Alexandra and Elin. Confirms that Saga is alert. Saga sits at a table beside Meat's friends, large and heavy and solitary. Saga stares down outsiders paying too much attention. She looks menacing. Linger too long and she will pin your hand to a table with your own blade.

Alexandra distributes more of the sukarek—the preparation the Elder Mothers made, small dark pellets bitter as gall. Alexandra is talented in the old ways, learned the precise preparation from her grandmother who learned it from hers. She will complete her initiation with distinction, first among her cohort. Destined to join the Elder Women's Circle, perhaps even become a Red Grandmother herself.

Sofie swallows one of the bitter pellets. There is stinging in her throat. Her stomach grows warm. The crowd around Meat thickens. The flock moves away from the dance floor. Toward the staircase by the bar. People look away. Do not stare. Do not anger them. Be grateful it is not you.

---

One of the youngest girls approaches Sofie. Black skirt, peasant blouse. Fifteen winters. Her knotted braids mark her as seeking a husband. Malin? Ida? She looks excited and nervous simultaneously.

*'I do not know if this matters—'*

*'Speak,'* the warmth in Sofie's stomach turns to a corrosive knot.

*'I think his brother possesses some knowledge. He reads runes, casts stones, they say.'*

*'What?'* Panic rises in Sofie's throat. She has missed something. A guardian does not miss things. *'Tell me!'*

*'They were arguing earlier, something about the finest night of his life and his brother saying no, the worst night of all lives. Some of the young ones heard them.'* Ida—or Malin—points at Meat's brother, Leif, down on the lower floor.

*'They cannot know, none of them. Their pride makes them blind. They cannot perceive her plans,'* Sofie says in a loud voice affected by the sukarek.

Ida continued, *'He was casting runes at a table below. He confronted one of the girls, but they told him it was Elder Circle business and to withdraw.'*

The flock gradually makes its way out using the staircase by the bar. Slowly, so nobody notices what is happening. As though anyone cared. As though anyone wished to notice them.

Sofie seizes Ida by the shoulders. Shakes her. Hard.

*'And you tell me now?'*

Ida looks terrified. Her eyes fill with tears. *'I did not know if it mattered.'*

*'Let me judge that, you foolish girl!'*

Large Saga stands beside them. *'What occurs?'*

Sofie takes a deep breath. Swallows bile. *'We have a complication.'*

---

The flock descends a dark spiral staircase. They escort Kari and Meat. More sukarek is distributed. The darkness is filled with footsteps, tittering girls, and music. The flutes from one direction, drums from another, the beat rising through the floor, vibrating their feet. Meat holds Kari's hand. She laughs and pulls him along. He gives little thought to why the other girls accompany them. He thinks of nothing at all. He simply wishes to reach the darkness and rut. Nothing else matters. And the girl holding his hand knows the way into the dark, the wet, hot dark. The girl has promised she will show him things he has never seen before. Things he will never see again. Things the men on his team will never experience in their pitiful lives. There will be rutting like no one has rutted before.

Leif wishes to be left in peace. Accursed foolishness. *'I am but a simple smith,'* he mutters. A pair of green, sad eyes seem to peer past the walls. They beckon and compel him to someplace quieter. He does not ask what they want, simply shambles along behind Sofie into a side passage where it is private. Sofie pulls the curtain across the passage entrance. Saga withdraws a weighted club from beneath her skirts and strikes Leif at the base of his skull. Sofie lights a lantern, the soft glow peeling back the dark, illuminating a few low couches and a table. Saga strikes him twice more despite his unmoving form. Sofie waits patiently. Saga is brutal, but she takes time getting to the point. She kicks Leif in the kidneys and stomps hard on the hand fumbling toward the top of his boot. Crunch. No hidden blade for Leif.

*'What did you tell him?'*

*'Rutting whore!'* spits Leif.

Saga smiles. The fool gives her every justification.

Leif to Sofie, *'You are not just another circle of Freyja's Daughters. The Jarl is going to kill you and that corpulent whore friend of yours.'*

Saga kicks Leif in the head. Brutally hard. *'Corpulent? Did you say corpulent, you bastard?'*

*'Restrain yourself.'* Sofie squats beside Leif. Tries to focus. Blood runs into Leif's eyebrows. *'My companion grows agitated. Simply tell me what you said to Meat, and all will be well.'*

Leif does not answer. Saga has his shoulder halfway up his back, her knee in his spine, face grinding the floor. By the time he begins to stutter an answer, there is a pop, and he cries out as his shoulder leaves its socket. In Kaarma, Saga spends her days doing hard labor. People say she is *'afflicted.'* She cracked her father's skull with a hot iron. Do not cross the girls from Anseküla.

*'I told him what I saw in the runes this day. If he lives through the night everyone dies. If he does not everyone lives.'*

That was unexpected.

Saga slams Leif's head into the stones so hard they shift. Dust and the iron smell of blood fills the air. *'What did you say?'* Sofie repeats.

*'Meddling hedge-reader,'* says Saga.

*'But will he heed you? Why did he go with them?'*

*'He never believes me. He thinks the runes are nonsense,'* whimpered Leif.

Sofie delivers a kick for each word. *'Why does a village smith think he can see the future?'* The rush of bile comes again. And Leif cannot answer. Sofie understands what will happen now regardless. She pulls Saga out. Out of the side passage and toward the exit staircase. The flock has already had time to reach the bog. Saga and Sofie run down the stairs, stumble in the dark, into the night. They are light-headed and breathless. The summer night is warm. There is a smell of grass, tobacco, and soap. Sofie stops and looks around. Saga runs into her back. She pants like an aged crone. It is dark behind the barn, but Sofie can see the path leading to the forest. The path to the Underryd bog. The moon illuminates broken blades of grass. A road of silver. Thousands of years old. The road from the dance pavilion to the grove by the bog. The bog where the tree branches look like slowly swaying tentacles. The road taken by the flock every fourth dark moon.

She sees them. The flock has already reached the place where the forest grows dense. The place where candles are extinguished and only moonlight and starlight remain. Just to be safe. Sofie glimpses a girl's white top through the trees. Hears laughter. The sukarek buzzes like wasps' nest in her head. It is as though all sounds are distant. But the preparation also grants night vision. Intensifies the light. The world turns black and corrosively white. Looking at the moon pains her eyes. The slightest sparkle in the grass becomes a star.

They run along the path. Through a tunnel of black and white. Saga is right behind. She will never be a runner. She trips in the grass. It sounds like a falling tree when she crashes into the bushes. Sofie keeps running. To the edge of the trees, where she slows. This is no place for haste. The forest does not appreciate it. The forest has no mercy for the careless. People disappear here. And the folk in Eysýsla do not spend much time searching for them. There is no point.

---

In the Year 876, a whole family vanished. *'Why were they gathering berries there?'* the farmers muttered. *'In Underryd. There are no berries there. There is nothing but stinking marsh.'* Sofie heard that tale during her apprenticeship. One of the older initiates had been to the bog. Found clothes and a pair of children's shoes.

Sofie wanted to know more. She was curious and restless and weary of tending to horses at the stables or watching travelers in town. The first time she followed the others to the forest she was fourteen winters old.

A bird shrieks. Some manner of bird of prey, perhaps an owl. Sofie takes a deep breath. It is pitch-black between the trees. Only occasional shafts of moonlight make their way down to her, illuminating leaves and branches and mist. It is always misty here in the forest. Something to do with the warmth of the earth beneath. Sea vapor. Primeval forest and bog. Sofie knows little of forestry. But when you walk before the flock you see how the haze and moonlight make the cobwebs glitter. The webs hang like curtains of silver across the path. It is easy to see things through curtains and swathes of mist.

Sofie hears wails from afar. They come riding on the corrosive veils of mist. They echo between the trees as if that is what they have always done. Girls roaring as though at a contest. Roaring like beasts in heat. Roaring like lunatics. Roaring as though summoning a god.

Out on the bog there is coupling in progress. Kari and Meat are rolling in the grass. They yap and claw at each other like dogs.

The girls stand half-naked around them in a breathless semi-circle. They clasp each other's hands hard. Stare at Kari arching her back. Her undergarments hanging on a juniper bush. Meat is rutting like an animal. They pant and snort and scratch and tear. Alexandra's sukarek is taking full effect now. Kari's eyes have turned black. She sees fire and spirits and trees with enormous phalluses. The trees promise to fulfill her wishes. She drools. Obscene. Babbling while she ruts as though speaking in tongues. He hammers like a bull at breeding that pounds and pounds and pounds. A bull with blood beneath his fingernails. The moon turns the blood black. And all skin becomes white and milky. The girls howl when they see the blood. They lean forward for a better look. They wish for beautiful children and prosperous lives. Journeys far from Kaarma. That is what the Goat promises. The girls press themselves against Anna, who stands at the center of everything. They pant, they fumble for each other and stare at the blood. Then the first sounds are heard from the bog. Whispering, mad tittering, and then a branch snaps with a crack. A few of the girls do not know which to watch anymore, the coupling or the darkness. Some keep staring at the coupling so they need not see. There is sobbing and panting. Elin wrestles one of the older girls to the ground and starts tearing at her blouse. Kari takes Meat's throat in a stranglehold. He grins like an idiot when she starts squeezing.

Anna untangles herself from the jumble of girls' limbs. She walks past the rutting heap, toward the darkness. The lunar haze spins around her. Sweat glitters on her naked legs. She raises her arms to welcome the thing approaching from the forest. They can all hear it now. The sound of the Messenger. The spawn of the Goat. The thing making the trees sway. Wrapped in moon-mist and partially hidden by branches it comes closer. It wades through pools and steps into quagmires. Trips over rotted stumps. Splashes like a great beast, a monstrous beast, in truth. At the edge of the bog it snaps a pine at the roots. Seventy-five feet of tree comes crashing down. Its crown strikes the ground before Anna. A cloud of pine needles and water washes over Meat and the girls. For anyone with sukarek-eyes it appears as though the bog is exploding in a cloud of diamonds. Anna does not retreat. She raises her arms toward the madness behind the tree crown and howls. The girls howl with her and the Messenger answers.

The Black Goat has a thousand young. The howls echo between the trees. Hoarse girls' voices and the roar of the Messenger from beyond time and space and reason. The sounds carry all the way to the barn. Guards tell people to come inside. In Underryd you remain indoors on nights such as this. You could catch your death if you linger outside. In the upper hall people look away nervously. They exchange glances as if to say *'It is time once more.'* The musicians play louder. Drink more deeply. Hurry into the Undercroft. The mist hanging over the field is full of death. Death, which can only be stopped by lust. With me, in the side passage. You there, come to the couch. People act like beasts. Fighting, shouting. Shapes rock to and fro in the dark. Children are conceived, young people are weeping. In a ditch a girl of seventeen winters lies covered in vomit, calling for her mother.

---

The roar makes Sofie stumble on the path through the undergrowth. She falls over a juniper and tears her arms and face. Strikes her head on a rock. She vomits wine and black sukarek and venison stew. When she closes her eyes she sees spirals of eerie lights circling Aldebaran. Wet and bleeding, she stands. Gets back on the path. Guardians do not lie vomiting in ditches. The guardian in Underryd has a duty to watch over. Her mother was a guardian once. And her grandmother's sister. It has been thus for years. For bloody ages.

She reaches the glade by the bog and sees everything in flashbulb white. Trees and mist. White girls' bodies in a panting heap. Their bags full of practical things tossed at the path's end. Small piles of clothes. Mantles and dresses they do not wish to soil. And then: Kari atop Meat. Anna, her arms upraised, turns toward the thing just emerging from the thickets by the pools. The girls cheering and screaming like mad. Kari wailing in ecstasy. Meat's legs thrashing. Half-strangled he releases his seed. Then catches sight of the living mass of limbs and branches and mouths. He roars without voice. He flails with his arms and points. Cannot they see how large it is? Says *'For the love of the Gods, run!'* with his pale blue eyes. Croaks like a raven.

Then Meat sees that the girls are not afraid. They appear pleased to see the thing rising above the bushes. He is the only one terrified out of his wits. He begins to understand. His brother had warned him. Drugged and drunk and strangled and rutted though he may be, he is not stupid. The girls do not look afraid. They are howling with excitement. Not fear. They are completely complicit in this. Meat tries to shake Kari off him. He arches his body. Tries to strike her. Claws her hands. The girls seize his arms. Press him down. Laugh at his panic. Cover his mouth.

The Black Goat has a thousand young. The forest echoes with the yells of the girls and the Messenger. Sofie remembers her first time in the forest. Remembers the euphoria. Fourteen winters old. Intoxicated on sukarek and red wine. Someone's hand inside her top. Standing so close to the people rutting that she could see everything. And then that vast, unfathomable thing standing there, swaying, at the edge of the trees. Like a thirty-foot piece of kelp on legs like bridge piers. Illuminated by the moon it resembles a dead tree. One that moves. It lashes out here and there with its tentacles and bellows. A limb as thick as a tree trunk makes its way toward Anna. Another whips the moss on the ground like an enormous dog's tail. A third tentacle gropes toward the moon. Sofie wet herself the first time she saw it. Then she screamed without cease for five minutes. It took a week before she could speak again. She could not remember what she had wished for.

But the most disturbing thing. The most obscene. It is what happens next, once the Messenger has acknowledged them. Sofie is surprised every time. Even though she has been in Kari's place. She does not see who strikes the first blow. But suddenly there is blood everywhere. And girls clawing, girls tearing, and girls kicking. Girls who throw Kari aside so they too can have a turn. Kari tumbles over the moss, lies there with her backside bare. Meat keeps rutting in his drugged death throes. His mind dying but his member fights on. He desperately scrawls a crude rune in the dirt.

---

Sofie stumbles toward the jumble of girls. She remembers her Meat. Aleksander from Pöide in the heart of Saaremaa. Dull as a stone. Wanted to be a musician. She still wears his ring on a cord around her neck. When she came home that first dawn her mother helped her bathe. Washed her like a small child. Sofie remembers the smell of blood in her hair. And how her father began avoiding her afterward. Never a harsh word from him again. Once you have been to the bog, something in you has died. Something else has been born.

The sukarek makes her trip over something. She rolls over the moss. The water is so close beneath that her skirts become soaked. The water smells of blood and rutting and rotted plants. The girls tear and tear at the figure in the glade. Cartilage and tendons crack. Elin and Lenni break one of his elbows. Snap it the wrong direction. They bend and bend and bend. Twist it off like a bird's wing. Overhead the Messenger looms. Observing what these two young women accomplish in their leisure time. The smell of blood excites it. It trembles and bellows. Its limbs lash the air above them.

Then Alexandra holds up a bloody bundle over her head and screams shrilly. *'Iä! Iä!'* The girls cheer. *'Iä! Iä!'* Anna roars at the Messenger in a pre-Cambrian tongue. Blood-spattered hands wave strips of flesh. Sofie joins in with the shrieking. Forgetting her duty. She desires to feast on the flesh. She tosses aside a couple of babbling companions. Julia and Lova. Or Lova and Maja. Who cares? Make way for the guardian. She sees a girl straddling the figure's hips while three others claw open his belly. Intestines everywhere. They split and reek of filth and vomit. Someone retches. Someone climaxes, howling like a beast. Lenni gives a witless grin, her mouth full of forearm muscle. Hunger tugs at Sofie. She bares her teeth and hisses. Lenni backs away slightly. The whites of her eyes shine in a mask of black blood. She defers to Sofie, who seizes the arm for herself. Sinks her teeth into a fleshy fold by the thumb. Briefly glimpses the figure's face among the jumble of girls. Something different about it, but no matter, in the darkness and covered in blood everything is chaos. His green eyes though speak volumes—terror and pain. She thinks to herself, *'The fool is still alive,'* and swallows flesh.

*'Iä! Iä! The Black Goat has a thousand young!'* The girls fight over scraps. His flesh. The holy sacrifice to the Goat in the forest. The girls from Underryd. They are the girls from Saaremaa. They feed each other raw, steaming flesh. Hardcore Maenads the whole group of them. Wailing cannibal priestesses feeding a monster of the abyss, smoking warm liver. Alexandra and Anna hold it up together toward the mass of limbs. The Messenger shakes with excitement as it wallows closer. Mashing the peat and dry twigs. Blundering onto firmer ground. There is a rustling of thrashing tentacles and a stench of death and marsh gas. A cluster of limbs snatches up the liver. It disappears upward in a spray of blood into the center of the Messenger. There is a glimpse of something that might be jaws. Chewing. Some of the girls toss it more meat. Little Nalim squats, her hands full of steaming entrails. She is weeping. And laughing. Alexandra kisses Anna and they fall down in a heap. Wrestling and pleasuring each other with fingers. Kari runs out into the bog. She wears nothing but a brief top and her skin shines white in the moonlight. She dances madly before the Messenger. Screaming, leaping up and down in a cloud of water drops.

Then Sofie remembers her task. There may be something wrong with Meat. That was it, yes. *'Wait,'* she croaks, spitting cartilage and bits of flesh. *'Wait.'*

She stumbles over to Anna. Anna is sitting astride Alexandra in the moss. There is blood and Alexandra's long hair everywhere. They feed each other strips of flesh. Bare breasts and witless grins. The Messenger hangs over them. Vast and reeking. It quivers. Makes monstrous leaps up and down on its massive legs. *'Wait,'* Sofie calls out. *'Wait, curse it!'*

Alexandra and Anna look up at her. Some of the girls stop throwing meat. They have empty eyes, all of them. The Messenger sniffs her scent. Who disturbs my feast?

Sofie leans over Anna. Looks into her crazed shimmering eyes. *'Listen! You must listen.'*

Anna collects herself. Nods. *'What?'* screams Alexandra. Above them, a limb sweeps dangerously near. Sofie feels her terror breaking through. If the Messenger loses control they are all dead. Soon she will start running. To the abyss with everything and just flee.

*'Listen to what?'*

*'His brother is a runecaster. He spoke something, something about transubstantiation.'*

*'WHAT?!'*

*'The bastard said he would die before letting us have his brother.'*

Alexandra mutters something and fumbles for Anna's breast. Anna pushes her away.

*'What? What? What? How could this happen? Under your watch?'*

*'I know nothing of runecraft,'* Sofie spat. *'I serve the Elder Gods like you, not those half-bloods the men are always prattling about. Odin this, Thor that—'*

Sofie backs away. In the corner of her eye she sees one of the Messenger's eyes staring at them. It is enormous. Ancient and altogether evil.

Being denied its anointed sacrifice makes it rage. An empirical fact. It can manage with the livers of drunken musicians. But poisons, or conflicting signs and sigils make it mad. It has killed two priestesses out of pure fury when it was poisoned before. In the Year 869 Marianne was decapitated. The girls had missed that their Meat bore the mark of Freyja and three of them were gravely injured. Anna's eldest aunt was the other one torn to pieces, in the Year 878. All they found was her right hand. Anna still keeps it in a linen bag at home, atop her dresser.

The girls sense something has happened. The gorging and heavy petting stops. Twenty misty pairs of eyes stare in her direction. *'Continue,'* Sofie wants to shout at them. *'Continue coupling so it does not notice.'* Twenty blood-black mouths jeer at her. Above her head, a tentacle stops mid-movement.

Then Kari comes reeling as though from nowhere. High on sukarek and intercourse. Her sex bare and her hair standing on end. Blood everywhere. The latest fashion for girls from Kaarma.

*'By the Gods!'* she laughs. *'Gods, Gods, Gods!'*

Every creature in the bog has its eyes on her. Sofie sees the movement before it has even begun. Sukarek-intensified perception. Not inadequate. A tentacle as thick as a tree trunk comes flying. Sofie rams Kari. A proper tackle. They fall into a puddle and the limb whooshes over them, hitting a clump of grass which explodes in a rain of silvered water droplets and pulverized vegetation.

*'What in the abyss!'* Kari shouts. *'Are you mad?'*

The next lash strikes six inches from her head. The water gushes up like a fountain once more. Kari screams outright. She is on her feet and halfway to the tree line in one movement.

All the girls retreat. The Messenger staggers toward them. It shakes, quivers. Totters. And strikes. Sparks fly when a whip lash strikes a rock. Sofie hears herself saying, *'By the Gods.'* One of the girls screams. A scream of terror. This is not amusing anymore. They are exposed. Half-naked in the forest with a truly nasty monster. A girl vomits up raw strips of flesh. Another retches. Before long they are all running. They say this happened once before, in the late seven hundreds. The ritual failed and half the flock was killed. It took years to rebuild.

Sofie meets Anna's gaze. Controlled and sober by sheer force of will. She hears her voice as though inside her head. *'We must rectify this.'* Sofie nods. Time slows. The girls' screams fade away and the Messenger freezes mid-motion. Sofie gestures, *'Get the girls out of here.'* Anna nods. *'Iä! Iä!'*

---

Sofie is as good as dead. Tomorrow she will sit at the Black Goat's side. The High Priestess rises slowly. Glances over her shoulder at the tangle of death hanging in the air overhead. The tangle of tentacles. Ten or more eyes. Total evil. This is grave. She is covered in blood. Her undergarments are half pulled down and her white blouse shines in the moonlight. She has moss in her hair. She is as beautiful as a goddess—the sister of the Goat. The snare, the seductress, and that which grows in the dark. She is the witch that tames the Messenger from the black beyond. She is the cry in the forest that entices the girls to dance. She is Anna from Pihtla. She is nineteen winters, going on ten thousand. She is the key to strange eons.

Anna walks toward the flock with upraised arms. Her blouse flaps like wings. Her face radiates, *'Come to me, children.'* No panic, no fear. She is the reassuring guide, the mother, the calm around which the world revolves. *'Follow me and you will be safe. Now let us all stand. Carefully. Let us walk away from this vexing monster. Mistress Sofie will manage it.'* The girls begin getting to their feet.

Sofie holds her breath. Stares at the girls and stares at a lodge pole of a tentacle less than three feet from her face. A twitch and she is dead. Not much pleasure in that. And furthermore she has a demonstration to present to the Circle. She turns around with glacial slowness. The Messenger keeps its gazes on her. Or its gaze? What does one say about something with eyes everywhere? Sofie notices the way her thoughts keep wandering. As soon as they get a chance they flee. Can so many eyes cast a glance? How does the world appear if you can see in all directions? As though from the inside of a sphere? She bows to the Messenger. Lifts her hands. A legion of tentacles are raised slightly, in response. She has its attention. It recognizes her. The girl who comes bearing gifts. Do you hear? If there is anyone to be wroth with, it is me.

She sees Anna and the girls in the corner of her eye. They are inching back. Together they are saving the flock. A girl, Sandra from Salme, stumbles over what remains of Meat's brother. She falls and crawls naked among the moss and pieces of flesh. The Messenger is startled. Its tentacles sway like kelp. It loses interest in Sofie. Turns its eyes to Sandra and Anna and the girls. Picks up the scent of the flock again. Sofie feels the panic rising. Among the girls and inside herself. But she is the guardian. A *custos*. One who has drunk the blood and waded in the darkness. One who preserves and protects. One who does not panic.

Sofie screams. With all her might. Roars to attract its attention. Howls at the night sky like a wolf. She calls for battle. Roars out, *'Take me, you hideous filth monster. Do you hear me, you bastard?'*

The Messenger turns to her again. It appears surprised. Or curious. It has been an eternity since someone shouted at it with defiance. It has been long since anyone challenged it. It lashes out at the little screaming thing with white hair. The creature ducks. It lashes out again. And again. The creature backs away, stumbles backward over the tufts of grass.

Sofie sees all the eyes. Feels how anger causes its mass of limbs to tremble and jerk one way, then another. The Messenger is enraged. First, an offering stolen and exchanged and now she stands there shouting at it. It climbs out of the moss and mud. Leaves the thicket. Comes swaying across the peat. Taller than ever it stretches toward the moon. As though wishing to display itself in all its foulness. Sofie has an eternity to think. Then it attacks again. The first lash passes high above her. A careless sidewipe. The next comes down slantwise from above. Shorter and straighter. She has time to leap out of the way. And again. She trips, falls over, rolls around in the moss and springs up again. Her clothes are soaked. A blow that would have felled a tree strikes the moss. And then another. Water and mud spurt up and Sofie jumps aside, then backward. She can manage single strikes. As long as the Messenger only uses one limb at a time she can survive. And if she can just get among the pines she can run. Easier said than done. She stumbles again. Something sharp stabs her in the thigh. Impales her. When she leaps up again it pains all the way down to her calf. A tentacle crushes the spot where she just lay. Another swipes her across the shoulder. A glancing blow. Another, thin as a finger, whips across her hand. A third over her thigh. The lashes burn, but she is still standing. She fumbles with her thigh and finds the sharp thing. A thick stick driven into her flesh. Losing her concentration for a moment, she takes a blow to her face that throws her like a rag across the tufts of grass. A tooth snaps. She feels it on her tongue. Her head is thundering, and when she opens her eyes she sees the silhouette of the Messenger against the stars. She smells the stench of corpse and mud. Sees the eyes indifferently watching her crawl. They do not even hate. They simply dislike the idea of her moving. Or breathing. Or even existing. It was given the wrong meat and now it wishes to kill and crush.

Sofie yanks the stick out of her flesh. The pain is unbearable. She disappears into a hole of whiteness and when she returns the Messenger has drawn closer. A thin tentacle scrapes against her calf. As though curious. Or lustful. Another, thick as a thigh, is raised over her face. Ready to club her. Six eyes scrutinize her intently. More tentacles come slithering up her leg. One pulls at her shoe. Another forces itself between her thighs. Spreads them apart. It is so vile. The wretch is groping her. Tentacles on her stomach. On her breasts. She holds her breath. If she moves she will receive the club in her face. It is finished. Sofie relaxes. Closes her eyes. She is dead. She will be one of the young waiting in the dark forest. A sister who got left behind at the bog. A tale to be told at home in the village. *'By all means go dance at the bog, but it is dangerous. Sofie, Bodil's daughter, got left behind out there.'*

She hears Anna's voice again. It comes in like a ghostly signal through the pain and terror. *'We are safe! Everyone made it. Thanks to you. You are holy, sister.'*

Sofie begins to weep. She would like to tell Anna to go to the abyss but her voice has gone. Her strength is gone. All of it. All she can think about is the limb above her. She looks up again. The moon turns it blue-black and makes the slime shimmer. The filth hangs down in threads, sticky as syrup. The skin beneath is rough. A glittering drop of slime falls in a long string of silver. It resembles a falling star.

*'Wait!'* someone calls out.

The Messenger freezes. The eyes register something behind Sofie. *'Take me instead, you accursed—'* The voice cuts off. Saga? *'—abominable monster!'*

The tentacles draw away from Sofie. She takes a deep breath. It has forgotten her. *'You are foolish. And I am too swift for you.'* Sofie rolls aside. Around, around. Away, away. Waits for the crushing blow. But nothing happens. She is soaked everywhere and her leg burns like fire. It is wonderful. She is alive. She looks up. The girls have gone. The remains of Meat's brother lie on the ground in a pile. And there: Large Saga striding over from the edge of the trees. With her hands at her sides and shoulders thrown back. She lumbers along as always. Straight at the Messenger, who turns toward her. Tentacles and eyes and everything. And Saga does not stop.

*'It was my fault. I am the one you should take.'* Saga's voice grows firm. Warlike. Mad. Sofie sees the blood in her hair. She must have fallen in the forest. It has run down and across her round face. She looks like one of the raiders painted for the hunt. Saga says: *'Sofie, care for the girls. I will manage this.'*

Sofie does not answer. What does one say to someone who has just decided to die in your place? You wave. An acknowledgment-wave and a farewell-wave in one. The Messenger stumbles toward Saga. Reeling across the quagmire like a drunkard. Hissing and gurgling. Saga goes to her death. Saga, who wished to be a guardian. Foolish Saga with her poor marks and bloodied knuckles. Foolish Saga whom no one dared torment even before she found her way to the flock. Saga the butcher, Sofie's shadow. Loyal as a dog. Kind as a dog. Mad as a dog. Sofie waves again. The world's most foolish gesture. Ever.

The Messenger towers over Saga. She looks up at the mass of eyes and limbs. She thinks she ought to say something. Anna would have said something impressive, in some ancient tongue. *'Iä! Iä!'* Or something about that black goat. All that business Saga never truly grasped. Much nonsense, really. This is not a goat. It is a filth monster. Standing two paces from her. Reeking like a midden heap. So vile. She sees the first blow coming in. Far to the right.

*'Your mother was an octopus and your father smelled of elderberries!'* she shouts. And attacks.

She connects a few slams with her club. It is like smashing foam. Then the Messenger strikes back. From all directions. Saga is thrown into the air like a stone, through the branches of a tree. Half her bones are broken. She has time to think of Sofie one last time. Then the limbs come together. She disappears among them. Like a fish in an anemone, Sofie thinks. They will never even find a finger.

And then it is finished. Ages pass while the Messenger plows its way back into the bog. Everything goes silent. Sofie kneels in the mud. She sits with her back to the forest and looks out into the mist, where the Messenger can be discerned, like a swaying tree. She sits there feeling the terror and the blood and the sukarek releasing their hold on her. All that remains is a hunched-up girl freezing and staring at the swathes of mist.

---

Slowly they dare to emerge. First Anna and Alexandra. They stand at the edge of the trees, Alexandra crouching and Anna erect. On their guard. Keeping watch over the situation. Somewhat. Only when the Messenger has disappeared far into the mist do the girls emerge. Frozen and half-naked and dumbfounded. They tiptoe past Sofie as though afraid of startling her off. Pointing and whispering. Sneaking over to clothes and sacks. Getting out their cloths, bottles of water, and clean undergarments. They cannot arrive in the villages looking like demons, after all. They help each other in pairs. Blood is black in the moonlight. No one mentions Saga.

Anna and Alexandra go over to what used to be Meat's brother. They root about in the mess. The body will be food for the badgers. The badgers in Underryd are diligent and corpulent. There is the occasional piece of bone and rags at the edge of the trees but that is all. Some of the clothes are old. Anna once found a bonnet that would have looked well on a lady from bygone days. You could still see the bloodstains.

The girls rub themselves clean and dry. The maenads disappear. Transform themselves into young women on a ritual journey. With pine needles in their undergarments—and does anyone have a mirror? A small bottle of spirits makes the rounds. They take large swallows to calm their shaking.

Anna explains. *'Saga was with us all night. She went back with Sofie and the rest of you. Everyone said goodbye and goodnight at the carts.'* The girls nod. Few of them look up from their tops and cloth napkins. *'Say you think she went with Sofie.'* No one answers. *'Sofie?'*

Sofie stands slowly. All the eyes of the flock on her back. She turns around. *'She came with me.'*

*'Good. How is the leg?'*

*'I can walk. I think.'* She stares at everyone. Her cheek is swollen from the monster's blow. *'No, I need no assistance.'* She is the guardian. The girl who stares down monsters. She walks without help. Otherwise there are others who would like to be guardians.

*'You need clean clothes,'* tries Alexandra.

*'Curse it.'* The steely monster-stare. Alexandra withdraws.

Together they walk back to the barn. Anna in front. Sofie last. The girls are silent. It makes Anna suspicious. Worried. Usually they begin chattering and giggling as soon as the bog is out of sight. And singing. But not this night. The girls are waiting for her or Sofie to do something. Anna simply does not know what.

A couple of times they hear sobbing—soft, hitching sounds quickly stifled. The owls call after them. It is cold in the forest. Someone is running a horse far away. One of the village fools. A raider in their war-gear. The ones you never want to become. The ones you want so desperately to avoid that you end up going to the bog to feed monsters. It is cold in the forest by the bog. The monsters may even consume you. But at least you avoid the fools. The young of the Goat have their own horses. And succeed in everything they desire. Unless they are torn to pieces.

Halfway to the barn, the numbness begins to crack. One girl stumbles and falls to her knees, retching. Another begins to shake uncontrollably. A third sits down abruptly on the path and will not move. Anna's perfect mask slips for just a moment—her hands tremble, her breath comes short. Then she gathers herself.

*'We walk,'* she says, and there is iron in her voice. *'We walk because that is what we do. We walk because the ritual demands it. We walk because to stop would be to acknowledge—'* Her voice breaks. She does not finish.

They walk. Some lean on each other. Some weep silently. Some move like the dead, eyes empty. But they walk. Because that is what they have always done. Because the compact demands it. Because to acknowledge the horror of what they have become would shatter them entirely.

Sofie limps at the rear, bleeding, watching the gap where Saga should be walking. The sukarek is wearing off now, leaving only exhaustion and pain and a hollow where feeling ought to be. She saved them tonight. At what cost? And for how long? Out on the bog a strange purple rend split the sky.

When they reach the party grounds, the laughter sounds forced. Too loud. Too sharp. They scatter quickly, melting into the crowd like ghosts. A few try to dance. Most simply sit, staring at nothing, drinking methodically. The Undercroft goes on. It always does.

---

Eskil felt the ground beneath him, the stars wheeling overhead. Kari's ragged breath on his neck, and then just as the tearing and clawing reached its crescendo, and her strangling hand tightened beyond endurance, he managed to trace in the dirt the rune his brother had spent many nights teaching him. A rune he had thought of as only protection, not something to put Leif at risk in his stead. A rune he had thought mere superstition.

The rune a key to Leif's greater work.

Not with his will, but with the power Leif had bound between them. An exchange written not in ink but in the fundamental substance of fate itself. When death reached for Eskil, Leif's life was forfeit.

Reality shattered like ice.

One moment: the bog, the girls, the Messenger descending like judgment from the void.

The next: standing in Leif's forge, the fires cold, ash settling in darkness. Outside, through the doorway, a purple wound opened in the sky above Underryd like a great eye tearing through the fabric of the world. Stars burned behind it in configurations that should not be—too bright, too close, too flat in their array.

Eskil stumbled, nearly fell, mind reeling from the displacement. *'Leif!'* he called into the empty forge. No answer. His brother was not here. Which meant—

Which meant Leif was *there*. At the bog. Naked and unmarked, thrust into Eskil's place with nothing but his own flesh to offer the Messenger.

*'No!'* He lurched toward the door, toward that spreading purple rift, toward the horror he needed to stop even knowing he could not—

*'Brother.'*

The voice came from from below the anvil. Frantically Eskil pawed at the floor, listening. The voice grew louder and offered encouragement, and straining his muscles he shoved the heavy anvil aside. A chest sat hidden beneath the floor boards. An iron skull lay within, wrapped in fine cloth, covered in runes that still glowed faintly with residual power. When Eskil lifted it, the metal was warm, almost alive in his hands.

*'Leif?'*

*'A fragment,'* the skull said, and yes, it was his brother's voice, distant but unmistakable. *'I prepared this before going to Eysýsla with you. Insurance. The rest of me...'* A pause, and in that pause Eskil heard everything his brother did not say. *'The rest is gone. Consumed. But this piece remains to guide you.'*

Eskil wanted to scream, to rage, to run back and undo what had been done. But Leif's voice cut through his despair like a blade.

*'Listen to me. You must understand what has happened. The ritual did not complete, but it touched you anyway. Your blood—feel it, brother. Feel what is in your veins now.'*

Eskil became aware of it then. A heat beneath his skin. A power thrumming through him with each heartbeat. His blood felt alive in a way it never had before—singing, burning, crackling with energy that seemed to want to burst free.

*'They were trying to prepare you as a vessel. To fill you with the vigor of our entire people—all their strength, all their vitality, all their essence concentrated in your blood so that when you were consumed, the Goat would receive tribute worthy of the compact. The ritual was interrupted, but the infusion began. You carry it now, Eskil. The power of Eysýsla flows in you.'*

*'I do not want it,'* Eskil whispered. *'I do not want any of this.'*

*'What you want does not matter. What matters is survival. That power will make you strong—stronger than any normal man. Faster. More resilient. You will need it, because they will never stop hunting you.'*

*'Who?'*

*'The Goat and her thousand young. You were promised to them. Prepared for them. They got a taste of what you are, and now they will hunger for you until the end of time. Your blood is supernaturally delicious to them—it contains everything they crave. Every moment of your life from this point forward, you will be hunted.'*

Eskil understood then the full horror of what had been done to him. He was not just marked—he was prey. Eternal prey. A feast that walked on two legs, never able to rest.

Outside, the purple edged rift in the sky spread like blood in water. Eskil watched through the forge doorway as it expanded, covering more and more of the heavens above Eysýsla. The stars within it burned with sickening brightness.

*'Get up,'* Leif commanded. *'Find a boat. Get off this island. Go south. You need distance and you need to disappear.'*

*'What about the village? What about—'*

*'Look behind you, brother.'*

Eskil turned. The purple edged rift was not just spreading—it was descending. Where it touched the earth, stone melted like wax. Wood burst into unnatural flame that burned purple and cold. The fortress was already going, its walls sagging and flowing like honey. The screaming had begun.

*'The compact is broken,'* Leif's voice said quietly. *'The Messenger was denied its anointed sacrifice and given a poor substitute. The Goat is displeased. Eysýsla will burn. Everything will burn. And then the wound will close, and it will be as though this place never existed. But you must be gone before that happens. Now move!'*

Eskil moved. He ran through streets already beginning to melt, past houses whose stones ran like water. People fled in all directions, screaming, burning with cold purple fire that consumed without heat. The purple wound in the sky grew larger, showing things behind it that should not be—geometries that hurt to perceive, spaces that folded through impossible tessellations.

He found a boat at the harbor. The purple fire had not yet reached this far. He cast off, the iron skull clutched against his chest, and rowed with desperate strength enhanced by the power now singing in his blood.

Behind him, Eysýsla died. The purple rift swallowed it completely—fortress, village, bog, forest, everything. For a moment the entire island seemed to fold in on itself, drawn up into that terrible wound in the sky. Then, with a sound like thunder played backwards, the rift closed.

Where Eysýsla had stood, only blackened stone remained. Burned and twisted and empty. The compact was broken. The Goat had taken her due.

Eskil rowed south through the night, following the coast.

---

The hunger came on the third day.

At first it was just a gnawing sensation, a tension in his jaw. Then it intensified—a craving so powerful it made his vision swim. Without thinking, he raised his hand to his mouth and bit down on his own wrist.

The taste that flooded his mouth was indescribable. Ecstasy and agony intertwined. His own blood was like liquid fire, like honey and lightning and something fundamentally vital. He understood in that moment why the Goat hungered for him. His blood contained the essence of his people—their strength, their vigor, their very life force concentrated and refined.

And it was more delicious than anything he had ever tasted.

He bit deeper, unable to stop himself, feeding on his own essence like a starving man at a feast. The wound healed almost as quickly as he made it—the power in his blood accelerating his natural regeneration—but in those moments of self-consumption he felt something break inside him.

*'Stop!'* Leif's voice was sharp as a whip-crack. *'Stop it now, you fool! That is what it wants! That is the curse working through you!'*

Eskil tore his wrist away from his mouth, blood dripping down his chin. He was shaking, horrified at what he had done.

*'The power in your blood calls to itself,'* Leif explained grimly. *'It wants to be consumed. It is trying to make you consume yourself. You must fight it, brother. You must be stronger than the hunger.'*

But Eskil knew himself. Knew his weaknesses. He was strong in body and will, but the craving he had just experienced was beyond anything human discipline could resist. If it came again—and it would—he might not be able to stop.

*'Then you will need protection,'* Leif said. *'Not from the Goat—nothing can fully shield you from that. But from yourself. You will need something to prevent you from getting to your own blood. Something locked. Permanent.'*

*'Like what?'*

*'You will figure it out. You were always good with your hands. When the time comes, you will know what to forge.'*

The journey took months. Eskil sailed south and east along the Baltic coast, making landfall in Courland. From there he traveled overland, selling his labor at each settlement, moving constantly, never staying long enough to be found. He followed trade routes that led through territories controlled by the Rus. He crossed rivers, forests, and plains. He portaged through narrow waterways and traded passage for work. Winter came and went. Spring arrived. And finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, he reached the great river Dnieper and followed it south to Kyiv.

The city loomed before him, vast and teeming, its walls and towers seeming to reach up to touch the sky. Here was civilization, order, law. Here he might find sanctuary.

Or so he thought.

A bottomless hunger always sublimated drove him to desperation and theft. The power in his blood made him faster and stronger than normal men, gave him an edge he thought would be enough. He was wrong. The city guard caught him red-handed and beat him bloody before dragging him to the dungeons.

In the darkness of the cell, he felt the hunger rise again. The wounds from the beating leaked blood that smelled like ambrosia. He had to clench his jaw shut, had to bind his own hands to keep them from his mouth.

*'This is not the end,'* the skull whispered. *'This is where you learn what you are made of.'*

Judgment came in the form of a merchant named Dmitri—fat, calculating, with a smile that never reached his eyes. He paid Eskil's fine, then informed him that he now owned his life.

*'You are big,'* Dmitri said, circling him like a buyer examining livestock. *'Strong. You will do well in the arena. Fight well, win often, and maybe you will earn your freedom. Or die trying. Either way, you belong to me now.'*

And so Eskil became a gladiator.

The training was brutal, but the power in his blood made him more than equal to it. He was faster than his fellow captives, stronger, more resilient. Wounds that would cripple others healed in days. He learned quickly, adapting to the rhythms of combat with frightening ease.

But with each wound, the hunger grew worse. The scent of his own blood drove him to distraction. More than once he had to be restrained after a bout, had to be locked away until the craving passed. The other gladiators thought him mad. Dmitri thought him damaged but useful.

Only Eskil knew the truth. And only Leif's voice, whispering from the skull he kept hidden in his cell, kept him from surrendering to the darkness entirely.

---

It was in the armory, between fights, that Eskil began his work.

He was permitted to maintain the weapons and armor—his skill at the forge, learned at Leif's side in what seemed like another lifetime, proving valuable. He worked quietly, methodically, repairing what was broken and reshaping what was bent.

And in secret, by candlelight in the dead of night, he forged his salvation.

First came the collar. Thick bands of steel, inscribed with runes of binding and protection that Leif's voice guided him to carve. It would lock around his throat, preventing him from lowering his head to his own wrists, from bringing his hands to his mouth. Once sealed, it would be permanent—he would wear it until death.

Then the helm. Not just protection for his skull, but a cage for his mouth. A sphere of steel covered in holes for sight and breath that would prevent him from biting himself. He crafted it to lock into the collar, the two pieces forming a single unbreakable restraint.

Into both he wove every scrap of protective magic he knew. Runes against hunger. Against madness. Against the call of the Goat and her spawn. They would not make him immune—nothing could—but they would give him a chance.

On the night he completed them, he donned both pieces and sealed them shut with molten iron, binding himself for all time.

The pain was exquisite. The metal burning against his skin, the runes activating all at once in a surge of power that made his vision go white. He screamed silently behind the helm.

When it was done, when the metal had cooled and fused, he felt the hunger recede. Not disappear—it would never disappear—but become manageable. Distant. The helm and collar were a barrier between him and his own destruction.

*'Well done, brother,'* Leif's voice was filled with something that might have been pride. *'Now you can survive. Now you can become what you need to be.'*

In the arena, Eskil became a legend. The helmed giant who never removed his armor, who fought with cold precision and terrible strength. The crowds loved him for his mystique, feared him for his efficiency. He killed when he had to, maimed when mercy was allowed, and with each victory earned coin toward his eventual freedom.

But more than coin, he earned knowledge. The gladiatorial life taught him to endure. To focus. To become a weapon that could cut through anything without breaking.

During his time in the arena, he also forged his true blade. Not the crude gladius he was given for bouts, but a warrior's weapon—long and heavy, inscribed with runes of warding and a prayer that had echoed through churches across the north: *A furore Normannorum libera nos, Domine.* From the fury of the Northmen, deliver us, O Lord.

It seemed fitting. He was a Northman, after all, and the fury he carried was terrible indeed.

His escape came during a great festival when Dmitri's household was distracted by revelry. His accumulated coin bribed the right guards. Eskil walked out, his new blade hidden beneath a cloak, and disappeared into the city's warren of streets.

They searched for him, of course, but he moved quickly and left the city with all haste, going south and east. He survived on scraps and charity, moving constantly, never staying long enough to be caught.

It was on the road south of Kyiv that he encountered the executioner.

Henrik was old, his hair gone to gray, but there was steel in his eyes and strength in his frame. He sat by the roadside sharpening a massive headsman's axe, and when he looked up at Eskil's approach, his eyes widened slightly.

*'Now that is interesting,'* the old man said. *'That helm and collar—those are runes of binding and protection. And unless I miss my guess, they are permanent. What kind of man locks himself in steel for life?'*

*'The kind who has no choice,'* Eskil replied.

Henrik studied him for a long moment, then nodded slowly. *'I have been in this business long enough to recognize all manner of strangeness. You have got the look of someone running from something. Maybe the law, maybe something worse.'* He stood, stretching. *'Name is Henrik. I am a guild executioner. And you are?'*

*'Eskil.'*

*'Well, Eskil, you look like you have had a hard road. I am heading west. Could use a traveling companion if you are willing to work.'*

And so began the strangest apprenticeship of Eskil's life.

Henrik was a master of his craft—not just the technical skill of ending life quickly and cleanly, but the philosophy behind it. *'An executioner is not a killer,'* he explained. *'We are instruments of justice. When we take a life, it is because society has deemed it necessary. We do it with precision, with dignity, without malice or pleasure.'*

Under Henrik's tutelage, Eskil learned the executioner's trade. How to maintain the blade, how to stand, how to strike with surety and speed. How to face the condemned with neither cruelty nor false comfort. How to bear the weight of taking life without letting it crush you.

*'You have got something in you,'* Henrik said one evening. *'A darkness that follows you. I have seen men marked by it before. Some let it consume them. Others learn to use it. The guild has use for men who walk in shadow. Men who can see things others cannot. Men who can stand against what lurks in the dark places of the world.'*

*'The guild's true history goes back further than any charter or royal decree,'* Henrik explained as they camped between towns. *'We began as witch-hunters in the old days, but we learned quickly that not all monsters wear human faces. Some things that walk in this world should not be walking at all. Some doors, once opened, do not easily close.'*

He stoked the fire, his weathered face illuminated by the flames. *'Every kingdom has its executioners. Every city needs someone to carry out the sentence when justice demands a life. But who do those same rulers call when their dungeons hold something that should not exist? When a village empties overnight and the survivors speak of things with too many limbs? When graves open from the inside and the dead walk with purpose?'*

*'They call us,'* Henrik continued. *'Because we already walk in death's shadow. Because we know how to cut clean and true. Because we have seen enough horror in the name of law that we do not break when we see horror that breaks all law.'*

They traveled together for three years. Henrik taught Eskil everything he knew—not just execution, but the lore of darkness. He spoke of vampires and werewolves, of ancient evils that had never truly died, of places where barriers between worlds grew thin.

*'The guild does not advertise it,'* Henrik said, *'but we have always been more than just headsmen. We are watchers. Guardians. When something from the other side crosses over, when darkness begins to spread, we are the ones called to cut it away.'*

When Henrik finally brought him before the guild masters, Eskil stood tall despite his eccentricities—the helm he would never remove, the collar locked forever at his throat, the iron skull that hung from his belt. The masters saw past the strangeness to the skill beneath. They saw a man tempered by fire, hardened by suffering, ready to serve.

They accepted him into their ranks.

Henrik died two years later, peacefully in his sleep. Eskil buried him with honor and continued the work they had begun together. But before he passed the old man pulled out a leather-bound journal, its pages filled with sketches and notes. *'The guild keeps records. Centuries of them. Creatures that feed on more than flesh. Spirits that possess the living. Ancient things that sleep beneath old stones until some fool disturbs them. We document what we find. We learn the signs. We share the knowledge and now I am passing on my knowledge to you. Take my journal, add to it, hunt the things in the dark, find their weaknesses, use your strengths.'*

He turned to a page showing a symbol Eskil recognized with a chill—a crude representation of something with too many limbs radiating from a central mass. *'When a master executioner travels, he observes. He asks questions in taverns. He notices when livestock disappear in patterns that make no sense. He watches for the signs—children who speak in languages they were never taught, priests who will not enter certain buildings. You are not the first to escape the cults of the Goat. Help others, help yourself. You are not doomed Eskil. Make your own fate.'*

He traveled from city to city, taking commissions, using the coin to keep himself fed and equipped.

But he never stayed long in one place. The stigma of the headsman followed him, and beyond that, there was always the risk. The Goat and her spawn still hungered for him. He could feel it sometimes, in the quiet moments—a presence just beyond perception, watching, waiting, craving.

His blood still sang with power. Still carried the vigor of his people. Still smelled like ambrosia to anything from beyond the veil. The helm and collar kept him from consuming himself, but they could not hide what he was.

So he kept moving. Kept his distance from others. Slept outside city walls when he could, away from the press of humanity and the weight of stone that seemed to close in like tomb walls. In larger cities, when work brought him within, he went cloaked and hooded, his massive frame concealed.

In quiet moments, he worked at his craft—mending armor, sharpening blades, shoeing horses for caravans. His hands were gentle then, careful, aware of his size and strength. A big man who had learned to move with deliberate precision.

But when the work called him, when he stood in the execution square with his great blade in hand, all gentleness fled. He was pure purpose then, a force of nature. Fast despite his size, focused despite the voices that plagued his mind—voices that fell silent in the face of duty, as if even they recognized that some work demanded absolute concentration.

And always, chained to his belt, the iron skull watched and whispered and remembered.

*'You are doing well, brother,'* it would say. *'You are surviving. You are becoming strong. But remember—they are still out there. The Goat and her thousand young. They will never stop hungering for you. Never stop hunting. One day, you will have to face them again.'*

Eskil knew it spoke truth. The mark on his soul was permanent. The power in his blood was eternal. He was bound to the hunt whether he willed it or not—both hunter and hunted, predator and prey.

But that was a reckoning for another day. For now, there was the road, the work, the endless wandering that kept the shadows at bay.

He was Eskil of Eysýsla, survivor of the broken compact, bearer of his people's vigor. Six feet and eight inches of twisted scars and muscle with shaggy black hair and pale blue eyes. When he could afford the materials, he dyed his skin red with henna and drew protective runes across his flesh—Norse runes of warding learned from Leif, Elder Signs from forbidden texts, and inverted symbols of the Goat's cult, all layered together to turn away those who served Shub-Niggurath and the outer dark.

He wielded a blade inscribed with a prayer for deliverance, wore protections he had forged himself from desperation and necessity.

He would continue walking, continue fighting, continue enduring, until the day the Goat finally claimed him or he found a way to cast her hunger back into the void whence it came. This was his burden. This was his purpose. This was the legacy of the Consort of Shub-Niggurath.
