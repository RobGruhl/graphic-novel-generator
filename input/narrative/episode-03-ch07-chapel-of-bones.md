# Episode III: To the Kurgan
## Chapter Seven: The Chapel of Bones

The chamber was a cathedral of death.

Skulls and bones alternated along the walls in patterns that might have been decorative if they had not been so horribly real—thousands of them, perhaps tens of thousands, arranged with terrible precision into columns and arches. The ceiling rose into darkness above, supported by pillars of femurs and tibias. The floor was flagstone worn smooth by centuries of feet.

In the center stood an altar of black stone. Upon it, bound hand and foot, lay Rahzalahn.

Behind the altar stood Karishkir.

She was beautiful—even now, even knowing more of what she was. Her body was painted with symbols in blood, her hair unbound and flowing past her shoulders, her eyes burning with golden fire. She wore nothing but the symbols and her smile.

To her right stood Drekhlo—bare-chested, his torso marked with twisted runes that seemed to writhe in the flickering light. Leather trousers and heavy boots. The great sword on his back was longer than Bansi was tall.

To her left stood Nizack, a ceremonial dagger raised above Rahzalahn's heart, ready to plunge down.

Behind them all, mounted on the wall of bone, hung the gold amulet. Heaps of treasure glittered beneath it—the accumulated wealth of the kurgan and more besides.

Cultists ringed the chamber, perhaps two dozen of them, their bodies painted and their eyes glazed with fervor.

Bansi grinned—a wild, savage expression that had nothing of mirth in it.

"Come get a bone, little doggies."

The battle erupted.

Gan drew and loosed. Her arrow missed Nizack by inches, but her falcon was already diving—the great bird's talons raked across Nizack's arm, drawing blood and forcing him to step back from the altar.

Bansi moved like smoke, tumbling across the bone-strewn floor, rolling beneath a cultist's wild swing, and coming up at the altar's edge. Her blade sang twice, severing Rahzalahn's bonds.

"Go!" Bansi shouted, and Rahzalahn rolled from the altar toward her.

Lüèduó rushed at Nizack, scarves trailing, the blade of his dagger seeking the sorcerer's throat—but his foot caught on a scattered bone, and his spectacular lunge became an even more spectacular miss. He landed sprawled across the altar itself.

Nizack's eyes lit with cruel amusement. "You'll do!" He lunged, his dagger driving toward Lüèduó's heart.

Lüèduó twisted desperately. The blade struck the stone altar and sparked, missing his chest by the width of a finger.

Across the chamber, Eskil charged toward the throne of bone where Karishkir stood—but Drekhlo intercepted him, the great sword clearing its sheath with a sound like tearing silk. Their blades met in a shower of sparks, the impact ringing through the chamber like a bell.

Giovanni dashed into the melee, his dagger finding a cultist's heart before the man could raise his weapon. Sadia was at his side, her blade cleaving through a cultist's spear and then through the cultist himself.

Isaac hung back near the entrance, his hands beginning to move in complex patterns, his lips forming words of power.

Karishkir threw back her head and laughed—a sound of pure, transcendent joy, as if this slaughter were the finest entertainment she had witnessed in centuries. Then she began to chant.

The words were in no language any of them knew, yet they understood them on some level deeper than comprehension. The syllables hurt to hear—they pressed against the mind like physical weight, like fingers probing at the edges of sanity.

Eskil heard her voice in his head, gentle now, almost loving: *Lower your sword. Kneel before me. I can give you everything you desire...*

"No." The word came out rough, almost a growl. "My soul, my flesh, has already promised to another."

Karishkir's eyes widened in surprise—and something that might have been respect flickered across her features before the battle reclaimed her attention.

Gan loosed another flaming arrow. This one found its mark, burying itself in Nizack's shoulder. Her falcon dove again, going for the sorcerer's eyes, and Nizack threw up his arms to defend himself—dropping his dagger in the process.

Bansi pressed Rahzalahn's spiked silver hair comb into her hand. "Can you fight?"

Rahzalahn's answer was to rise and throw herself at the nearest cultist.

Lüèduó scrambled off the altar and began to dance—not attack, not defend, but dance. His scarves whirled around him as he spun closer to Karishkir, weaving patterns of distraction and misdirection, trying to draw her attention away from the others.

It worked too well.

Karishkir's arm shot out—extending far beyond what any human limb should reach—and her clawed hand closed around Lüèduó's throat. She dragged him toward her, her other hand raking at his face.

He twisted at the last moment. Her claws carved bloody gashes across his cheek instead of tearing out his eyes.

Eskil and Drekhlo traded blows like ancient rivals, their swords singing the song of steel on steel. Drekhlo was fast—impossibly fast—and strong beyond human measure. He landed a blow that slashed across Eskil's chest, drawing blood even through the warrior's armor.

"Die!" Drekhlo snarled in the tongue of the northern raiders—similar but distinct from the dialect of Eskil's people. His blade swept toward Eskil's neck.

The blow struck Eskil's metal collar—the rune-inscribed steel fused forever to his flesh—and glanced away in a shower of sparks.

Giovanni saw one of the drummers beginning to transform, fur sprouting from his skin, his jaw distending into a muzzle. The priest stepped forward and drove his dagger up through the creature's throat and into its skull, ending the transformation before it could complete. Stilling him with a follow up to the heart.

Sadia took the second drummer—her sword through his chest, and then, for good measure, she grabbed a torch from the wall and shoved it into the thing's gaping mouth. The stink of burning hair and flesh filled the chamber.

Isaac's chanting reached a crescendo. Light began to pour from his upraised hands—pure, brilliant, painful light that flooded the grimly lit chamber like the wrath of heaven itself.

The cultists howled and writhed, covering their eyes. Nizack staggered, blinded, his half-formed portal flickering and beginning to fade.

Eskil, too, was caught in the brilliance. He staggered, momentarily blind—and Drekhlo broke his weapon free of their interlocked grip.

"Come, my love!" Karishkir's voice cut through the chaos. She threw Lüèduó aside like a discarded toy and dived toward Nizack's failing portal.

Drekhlo ran after her. But he paused at the threshold, pointing his great sword back at Eskil.

"I have marked you, and when we meet again, I will drink your blood from your empty skull!" he called, his voice carrying clearly despite the din.

Then they were gone—Karishkir and Drekhlo plunging through the shimmering doorway, the portal snapping shut behind them with a sound like breaking glass.

---

The light faded. The cultists lay dead or dying, struck down by steel and flame and the brilliant assault of Isaac's magic.

Nizack stood alone.

He staggered in a circle, abandoned by his queen, his fellow lover fled. Blood ran from his shoulder where Gan's arrow had struck. Blood ran from his neck where—

Where Rahzalahn's hairpins protruded.

She had crept up behind him during the chaos. Her spiked silver hair comb had found his throat.

Nizack turned to face Lüèduó and Bansi as they approached. He tried to speak—perhaps to beg for mercy, perhaps to curse them—but only a wet gurgle emerged.

Bansi looked at Lüèduó. Lüèduó looked at Bansi.

Together, they drove their silver daggers into Nizack's heart.

The sorcerer's body did not simply die. It disintegrated—crumbling from within, the flesh charring and collapsing as if consumed by invisible fire. In moments, nothing remained but ash and the fading echo of his scream.

Eskil retrieved the amulet from the wall of bone, handling it with extreme care. He thrust it into a sack and began inscribing runes of binding upon the leather—whatever protection he could offer against the thing's malevolent influence.

Giovanni stood apart, staring at nothing. In his mind, he was somewhere else—a woodland in Italy, years ago, sitting beneath the trees below a monastery. An elderly Franciscan monk sat beside him, speaking words that had seemed like gentle counsel at the time but now felt like prophecy.

*"You know, holy men have always been able to command beasts. Do not forget the crucifix you wield."*

He touched the crucifix at his throat, and the vision faded.

Isaac led them out through tunnels that connected to the catacombs beneath the great mosque of Merv. They emerged, blinking, into morning light—dragging sacks heaped with the cult's illicit treasures, covered in blood and filth, carrying weapons still dripping with ichor, looking like demons escaped from hell.

The imam who found them immediately raised a throaty cry for the city guard.

This time dozens of armored men responded quickly, bows knocked intent to kill. But the group had no energy for resistance left. Still hollowed from what had transpired, they moved slowly and protested little, barely raising their eyes in protest.

The Ahmira of Merv received them in her palace, surrounded by still more soldiers with drawn swords. She was a woman of middle years, her face hard and unforgiving, her eyes missing nothing as she looked them over. She took in their bloody stains, their wounds, and their weapons and eyed the sacks of treasure they dragged behind them. Holding her breath for long minutes, as though to avoid the stink of them.

She glowered down at them from her throne.

"I should have you all on crosses," she said, "or drawn and quartered for meddling in things that do not concern you."

No one spoke. There was nothing to say.

"But." The Ahmira leaned back, her expression shifting slightly. "You have rid our city of an evil. The creatures beneath the mosque—they have plagued Merv for some time. My grandmother spoke of them, and if she told no lies, then her grandmother to her." She paused. "I will let you go. With half of your treasure."

It was not a negotiation. It was a pronouncement.

They accepted.

Hind met them at the caravan, her face showing the strain of the past days. Rahzalahn was with them, pale and shaken but alive. The oud player embraced Hind briefly—a gesture that spoke of debts beyond mere employment—and then retreated to her tent.

The amulet rested in its protective sack, the runes Eskil had inscribed glowing faintly with contained power.

"Karishkir escaped," Lüèduó reported. "And Drekhlo with her. They went through a portal—we don't know where."

Hind nodded slowly. "And Nizack?"

"Dead." Bansi's voice was flat. "Truly dead. But we don't know why they defiled the kurgan."

"And the girl? Earmack?"

Silence answered her.

Hind closed her eyes briefly. When she opened them, her voice was steady. "She died fighting. Her people will hear of it." She turned to Abu-Rayhan, who had accompanied them back to the caravan. "The amulet—can you read it now?"

The scholar shook his head. "Some of the symbols, perhaps. But to truly understand it, we would need the source." He paused. "Egypt. The Stygian temples. Whatever this thing is, whatever power it holds—the answers are in the sands."

Hind looked at each of them in turn: Eskil with his rune-scarred skin and steel collar; Giovanni with his crucifix and his haunted eyes; Bansi with her collection of blades and her street-born wariness; Lüèduó with the fresh wounds across his cheek and the weight of the Nagini's debt upon his soul; Gan with her faithful dog and her hunter's patience; Sadia with her blades anointed in a dead girl's blood.

"Shiraz, then," Hind said. "The caravan leaves at dawn."

Behind them, the oasis of Merv shimmered in the heat—a green jewel in the desert, beautiful and deceptive, its darkest secret now silent once again beneath the earth.

Ahead lay the road to Shiraz, and the older darkness that waited there.
