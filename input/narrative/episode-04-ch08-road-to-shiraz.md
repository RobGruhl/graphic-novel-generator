# Episode IV: Shiraz and the Sea
## Chapter Eight: The Road to Shiraz

The caravan departed Merv three days after emerging from the confrontation in the Chapel of Bones.

They left behind them a city that would speak in whispers for generations of the night when screams had echoed from beneath the earth, when flames had bloomed in the darkness of the catacombs, when something had *changed* in the character of the shadows that pooled in Merv's ancient corners. The governor's men had sealed the entrance to the underground passages with stones and mortar, and priests of three faiths had spoken words of blessing over the site—but those who passed near the chapel of Saint Methodius still quickened their steps, and dogs whined and pulled at their leads when their masters walked them too close to that haunted ground.

Hind's caravan wound westward through the passes that led toward Persia, toward the fabled city of Shiraz where merchants grew fat on the profits of the silk trade and poets composed verses that would outlive empires. They traveled as guards now—the party that had faced ghouls and werewolves and things that defied naming—and the other members of the caravan regarded them with a mixture of gratitude and unease. These were not ordinary sellswords. These were something else entirely.

The road was long, and it was not without its dangers.

Bandits struck twice in the mountain passes—desperate men driven to outlawry by famine or misfortune, who saw in Hind's laden wagons the promise of wealth beyond imagining. They learned their error quickly. The first band scattered after Eskil cleaved their leader from shoulder to hip with a single stroke; the survivors fled into the rocks and were not seen again. The second band was more numerous, more organized, attacking at dawn when they thought the caravan guards would be sluggish with sleep.

They had not reckoned with Gan's falcon, which spotted their approach from half a league distant. They had not reckoned with Bansi, who moved through their ranks like a ghost, her scimitar drinking deep of their blood before they knew she was among them. They had not reckoned with Giovanni's voice, rising in prayer that seemed to fill his companions with strength beyond mortal measure. And they had certainly not reckoned with Lüèduó, whose serpent-nature allowed him to sense their ambush before it was sprung, the Nagini whispered warnings in a voice only he could hear.

The bandits died, or they fled. None surrendered—perhaps they sensed that mercy was not a luxury this company could afford, not in lands where a moment's hesitation could mean death for everyone under Hind's protection.

In the aftermath of these skirmishes, the party found themselves working together with an ease that had not existed before. Giovanni discovered that he could anticipate Eskil's movements, could position himself to support the Norseman's devastating charges. Bansi learned to read the subtle shifts in Lüèduó's posture that telegraphed when he had sensed danger. Gan's arrows found the gaps in enemy formations that the others created, and her animals—the dog, the falcon—became extensions of the party's awareness, watching flanks and rear while human eyes focused on the threat ahead.

They were becoming something more than fellow travelers. They were becoming companions, a weapon with multiple edges, each blade honed to complement the others.

And yet, even as they drew closer together in battle, certain mysteries remained.

---

Eskil always slept alone in a separate tent.

This was not merely preference—it was necessity, enforced with a quiet insistence that brooked no argument. When the caravan made camp, the Norseman would pitch his small tent at the edge of the circle, far enough from the others that his restless movements in the night would not disturb them. He claimed it was because of nightmares, because the horrors he had witnessed in his homeland still haunted his sleep. This was true, as far as it went.

But it was not the whole truth.

Sadia was the first to notice. She had drawn the late watch one night, and her circuit of the camp's perimeter brought her past Eskil's tent just as the first grey light of false dawn began to seep across the eastern horizon. She heard sounds from within—not the thrashing of a man caught in nightmare, but something else. Something that made her pause, her hand moving instinctively toward her sword.

A soft rustling. A chittering, barely audible. And beneath it, a sound that might have been chewing.

She did not investigate further. Some instinct—the same instinct that had kept her alive through years of service to Hind—told her that what transpired within that tent was not meant for human eyes. She completed her circuit and said nothing to anyone, though she watched the Norseman more carefully after that.

The truth was stranger than anything Sadia could have imagined.

Each night, as Eskil's consciousness surrendered to exhausted sleep, they came. Worms from the earth, beetles from beneath stones, moths from the darkness between stars—creatures that crawled and flew and burrowed, drawn by something in his blood, something in the curse that Shub-Niggurath had laid upon him. They poured into his helm through the gaps in the metal, they crawled beneath his collar and across his rune-marked skin, and they fed themselves to him. Mandibles parted his lips, bodies slid down his throat, and his sleeping form consumed them without waking, without awareness, nourished by a feast that no conscious mind could have accepted.

When dawn came and Eskil stirred, they departed as mysteriously as they had arrived—burrowing back into the earth, taking wing into the fading night, leaving no trace of their presence save a vague sense of satiation in the Norseman's belly. He did not know. He did not remember. He only knew that during their overland travels, he rarely felt hunger, rarely needed to eat more than a few mouthfuls of bread to maintain his enormous frame.

It was different on the ships. When they sailed, when there was no earth beneath his feet, when the creatures that served Shub-Niggurath's purposes could not reach him—then the hunger came. Then Eskil ate three men's portions and still felt empty, still felt the gnawing void within him that the insects had been filling without his knowledge.

He complained of it sometimes, this shipboard appetite. The others attributed it to the disorientation of sea travel, to the Norseman's unfamiliarity with life afloat. They did not know the truth.

Perhaps it was better that way.

The caravan reached Shiraz after six weeks of travel, and the party found themselves suddenly wealthy.

Their shares of the treasure recovered from the cursed castle and the catacombs beneath Merv—combined with Hind's generous compensation for their services as guards—amounted to more gold than most of them had ever possessed. For a few days, at least, they could live as lords and ladies, indulging whatever pleasures the ancient city offered.

Each spent their wealth according to their nature.

Giovanni sought out the Christian churches of Shiraz—small, beleaguered communities that existed in the shadow of Persian Islam—and distributed gold among them with the quiet generosity of one who remembered what it was to have nothing. He sent a portion of his earnings westward, entrusting it to a merchant caravan bound for Constantinople with instructions that it should ultimately reach Bishop Paulus in Rome. The Bishop had trained him, had shaped him into the weapon he had become; it seemed only fitting that Paulus should share in the fruits of Giovanni's labors.

It was during one of these charitable visits that Giovanni encountered a slave.

The man called himself Hassan in the markets of Shiraz, though his features spoke of Italian ancestry—the olive skin, the dark eyes, the aquiline nose that might have graced a Roman bust. He claimed to have been captured by pirates years ago, sold through a chain of markets that had eventually deposited him here, in the household of a Persian merchant. His Latin was rusty but recognizable, his manner that of a man who had once known better circumstances.

Giovanni's heart moved with compassion. He negotiated the man's freedom, paying a sum that the merchant accepted with poorly concealed delight, and invited the former slave to join Hind's caravan as a free man.

"I will call you Paul," Giovanni said, "for you have been reborn into liberty, as Saul was reborn as Paul on the road to Damascus."

The man who would call himself Paul smiled, and something in that smile should have warned Giovanni. But the priest saw only gratitude, only the joy of a fellow Christian restored to freedom, and he welcomed the predator into their midst without suspicion.

Bansi spent her gold on steel.

She found a weaponsmith in the Persian quarter whose work bore the hallmarks of true mastery—blades that sang when drawn, edges that could split a silk scarf drifting on the wind. She purchased a scimitar of exquisite quality, its curve perfect for the slashing strokes she had learned in the palaces of Sonapura, its balance such that it seemed to move of its own accord in her hand.

But the blade was nothing without the skill to wield it. So Bansi also sought out a teacher.

She found him in a courtyard behind a caravanserai, an old man whose face bore the scars of a hundred battles and whose eyes held the calm certainty of one who had faced death so many times that it held no terror for him. He agreed to teach her—not because of her gold, which he accepted with indifference, but because he saw something in the way she moved, something that reminded him of his own youth.

For two weeks, while the caravan rested and Hind conducted her business in the markets of Shiraz, Bansi trained. She drilled forms until her arms burned and her legs trembled. She sparred with the old man's other students, learning to read attacks before they were launched, to flow around defenses like water around stone. She absorbed techniques that had been developed over centuries of Persian warfare, adapting them to her own style, her own body, her own understanding of violence.

When she emerged from those two weeks, she was no longer merely dangerous. She was deadly.

Lüèduó debauched.

This was, perhaps, inevitable. The Raven had always possessed appetites that exceeded those of ordinary men, and Shiraz offered temptations that would have challenged the resolve of saints. He sampled the city's wines, which flowed despite the Prophet's prohibitions in establishments that catered to foreign traders. He sampled the city's pleasures, which were varied and inventive and entirely suited to one of his proclivities.

He was not alone in these indulgences. Sadia, Hind's warrior-woman, crossed his path in a house of pleasure near the merchant quarter—she equally in need of release after the horrors they had faced, equally determined to drown memory in sensation. They spent several days in each other's company, though neither would speak of it afterward. Some experiences were meant to remain private.

It was during one of these epic benders that Lüèduó encountered something unexpected.

He and Sadia had rented a room in an establishment whose proprietor asked no questions and provided no judgments. They had been drinking a wine made from pomegranates, which tasted of summer and forgetfulness, when Sadia noticed that the room had grown cold along one wall.

Not merely cool—*cold*, the kind of cold that seeped into bones and made breath visible in the air. In the room next to them, slumped against the wall, were two corpses. These bodies had been deposited recently, and they were frozen solid, their skin blue-white with frost, their eyes open and staring at nothing.

"We should leave," Sadia said, her hand finding her blade.

But Lüèduó's attention had been captured by something else. Further inside in an open courtyard floating suspended as if by invisible strings, was a lute. Its strings were moving, plucking themselves in a melody that was hauntingly beautiful—music that seemed to come from somewhere far away.

"We should take that," Lüèduó said.

Sadia stared at him as if he had lost his mind. Perhaps he had. But something in that music called to him, something that resonated with the serpent-nature coiled at the core of his being. This was no cursed object, no trap waiting to be sprung. This was something *old*, something powerful, something that had been waiting for someone worthy to claim it.

They stole the lute. They wrapped it in cloth to muffle its endless playing, slipped out the back of the establishment before anyone could investigate the cold or the corpses, and made their way through Shiraz's darkened streets toward Hind's encampment.

The corpses they left behind. Let others puzzle over that mystery.

Eskil sought knowledge.

The markets of Shiraz were famous for many things—silk and spices, carpets and ceramics—but they also harbored darker merchandise. In the narrow alleys behind the grand bazaars, in dusty old shops, one could find books.

Eskil moved through these shadowed markets with the focused intensity of a man on a sacred mission. He sought texts that might help him understand the curse that twisted through his blood, the powers that had claimed him, the fate that Shub-Niggurath had decreed for all her consorts.

He found fragments. Pieces of a puzzle too vast for any mortal mind to assemble. Scrolls in languages he could not read, books whose pages seemed to shift when he looked away, manuscripts that made his eyes water and his head pound with the effort of comprehension. He purchased what he could afford, and he brought his acquisitions back to Abu-Rayhan and Isaac, the scholars who traveled with Hind's caravan.

Together, they worked to piece together meaning from madness.

The fragments spoke of the Outer Beings—entities that existed beyond the boundaries of the world, in spaces between spaces, in times before time began. They spoke of cults that had worshipped these beings since before humanity learned to write, of cities that had risen and fallen while the ancestors of men were still learning to walk upright. They spoke of Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, and of the fate that awaited those who had been marked as her consorts.

Eskil learned nothing that gave him hope. But he learned, and knowledge—even terrible knowledge—was its own form of armor against the dark.

---

It was during one of these days of indulgence that the party returned to camp and found Eskil alone.

The forge that Eskil had established for repairs was cold, its coals banked, its hammer silent. Eskil stood before it, his massive frame swaying gently, one finger extended above the anvil. And on the anvil, a single caterpillar reared on its hind segments, its soft body undulating in time with Eskil's movements.

They were dancing together.

There was no music that human ears could hear—and yet there was music, clearly, some rhythm that connected the Norseman and the insect in a communion that transcended species, that transcended perhaps the boundaries of sanity itself. Eskil's body moved with a grace that seemed impossible for one so large, his finger tracing patterns in the air that the caterpillar mirrored with its own strange anatomy.

Bansi opened her mouth to speak—and Giovanni's hand closed on her arm, warning her to silence. They watched for a long moment, witnesses to something they could not understand and would never fully explain.

Then the caterpillar dropped to all its legs, scuttled to the edge of the anvil, and disappeared over the side. Eskil blinked, shook his head as if waking from a dream, and turned to face them.

"You have returned," he said. His voice was rough, confused. "I was... dancing or dreaming."

"You seem tired," Giovanni said awkwardly. "The heat out here combined with the forge can rob a man of his senses." Eskil nodded slowly, accepting this explanation despite its obvious inadequacy.

The moment passed. They spoke of other things—of Bansi's training, of Giovanni's charitable works, of the mysterious lute that Lüèduó had acquired. They did not speak of caterpillars, or of dances without music, and spared him of prying into the strange communion between a cursed man and the creatures that served powers beyond human comprehension.

Eskil had actually been celebrating for he had used some of his wealth to pursue his private war.

He had found another cult of Shub-Niggurath.

Shiraz, it seemed, harbored worshippers of the Black Goat—a small cell of devotees who conducted their obscene rituals in the basement of a warehouse near the tanneries, where the stench of their work would be masked by the smell of curing leather. Eskil had tracked them through whispers and rumors, with the greasing of palms and bribing of guards. He destroyed them.

The details of that night would remain his secret forever. Suffice to say that when the sun rose, the warehouse was empty of living worshippers, and the symbols painted on its walls had been scrubbed away with the blood of those who had painted them. Among the survivors of the cult was a young man whose condition mirrored his own.

Lod was his name. Another Meat destined for Shub-Niggurath, another soul promised as food and betrothed to the Black Goat. But where Eskil had retained his strength, his will, his capacity for resistance, Lod had been broken. His mind wandered. His spirit had been shattered by communion with powers that exceeded mortal comprehension. He did not speak; he barely acknowledged the world around him. But he was alive, and he was free of the cult that had claimed him.

Eskil brought him back to Hind's caravan.

"This is Lod," he told Hind, his voice brooking no argument. "He will work the forge. He is... damaged, but he can still shape metal. I will watch over him."

Hind asked no questions. She had learned that there were some things about her strange guards that she did not wish to know.

Eskil crafted for Lod a helm and collar like his own—steel bands that would prevent the poor wretch from tearing at his own flesh with his teeth, from biting through veins and arteries in moments of the madness that sometimes claimed him. He taught Lod how to apply the protective runes using henna and dyes, how to maintain the symbols that held back (however imperfectly) the call of Shub-Niggurath.

It was not salvation. It was not hope. But it was something—a small act of defiance against the powers that had claimed them both, a refusal to abandon another soul to the darkness that waited at the edges of the world.

Lod became a fixture of the caravan, a silent presence at the forge, his hands remembering the work even when his mind was elsewhere. Sometimes Eskil would find him standing motionless, his eyes focused on nothing, his lips moving in words that made no sound. At such times, the Norseman would press bread into his hands, would speak words of comfort that Lod probably could not hear, and would wait until the moment passed and something like awareness returned to those hollow eyes.

They were brothers, after a fashion. Brothers in damnation, if not in blood.
