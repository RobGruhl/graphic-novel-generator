# Prologue I: The Shepherd Who Became a Wolf

In the hill country north of Venice, where the land rises in terraced fields toward the Alps and the air smells of earth and wild thyme, there was a boy named Giovanni who knew nothing of cities or gods or the darkness that moves beneath the world.

He was the third son of a farmer whose ancestors had worked the same rocky soil for generations uncounted. His hands were calloused from the plow before he was ten. His back knew the weight of seed-sacks and water-buckets, the ache of harvest-time when dawn came early and dusk late. He spoke the vulgar Latin of the countryside, thick with local dialect, and knew no letters beyond the mark he made to sign his name.

It was a hard life but not an unhappy one. The soil was poor but it yielded enough. The winters were cold but the family survived them. Giovanni's father was stern but fair, his mother gentle but worn by childbearing. His brothers were strong, his sisters dutiful. They prayed to God and the saints with simple faith, attended mass when the circuit priest came through, and asked nothing more of heaven than that the crops not fail and the children not starve.

Giovanni would have lived and died in those hills, would have taken a wife from a neighboring farm and raised sons to work the same cursed earth, would have been buried in the little churchyard where his ancestors slept. That was the shape of his destiny, written in the lines of his father's face and the furrows of the field.

But God, or something that called itself God, had other plans.

The merchant came to the village in Giovanni's fifteenth year, during the autumn market when farmers brought their surplus to trade. He was a Venetian, sleek and well-fed, with rings on his fingers and a calculating eye that missed nothing. He moved through the market stalls like a shark through shallows, assessing, evaluating, determining what profit could be extracted.

Giovanni's father had brought a cartload of wool to sell---the shearing from their small flock of sheep, the labor of an entire summer. The Venetian examined it with practiced hands, pulling at the fibers, checking for coarseness and length.

'Not bad,' he said. 'Not exceptional, but not bad. I'll give you twelve denari for the lot.'

Giovanni's father knew it was worth twenty at least, probably twenty-five in a Venetian market. But here, in this backwater village with no other buyers for miles, twelve denari was better than nothing. He haggled half-heartedly, got the merchant up to fourteen, and accepted defeat with the resignation of one who has lost this battle many times before.

Giovanni watched the transaction with something burning in his chest. Anger, perhaps. Or shame. The merchant saw it.

'You don't like it,' the Venetian said, addressing Giovanni directly for the first time.

'No, signore.' The words were out before Giovanni could stop them.

'Why not?'

'Because it's not fair. Because you know what that wool is worth in Venice, and you're paying half of it.'

Giovanni's father cuffed him hard across the ear. 'Apologize to the signore. Now.'

But the merchant was laughing. 'No, no, let the boy speak. He's got fire in him. And he's not wrong---I will make a profit on this wool. A good profit. That's what merchants do, boy. We find value where it sits undervalued and move it to where it will be prized. There's no sin in that.'

'Then why not pay what it's worth?' Giovanni demanded, emboldened by the merchant's laughter despite his father's glare.

'Because your father needs to sell it today, and I'm the only buyer here. If he wants to haul it to Venice himself, he's welcome to try. But the cost of the journey, the time away from the farm, the risk of thieves on the road---all of that is worth something too. I'm not cheating him. I'm providing a service.'

The merchant studied Giovanni with interest. 'You can read or write, boy?'

'No, signore.'

'Count?'

'To a hundred.'

'Smart. Quick-witted. Angry at the unfairness of the world.' The merchant nodded to himself. 'How would you like to come work for me? I need someone to help with the hauling, keep the books, learn the trade. The pay's not much at first, but it's better than farming. And you'll learn things. See the world beyond these hills.'

Giovanni's father started to refuse---he needed his sons for the farm---but Giovanni spoke first.

'Yes,' he said. 'Yes, I'll go.'

And just like that, the shape of his life changed.

The merchant's name was Marco, and he dealt in wool and wine, olive oil and grain, and occasionally in things less savory when the profit margin justified it. He taught Giovanni to read and write, first in vulgar Latin and then in proper Latin, the language of contracts and Church. He taught him Greek for dealing with Byzantine traders, spoken Hebrew for the Jewish merchants who controlled much of the Mediterranean trade.

Giovanni proved an apt student. He had the kind of mind that absorbed information like dry earth absorbs rain---greedily, gratefully, storing it away against future drought. He learned to keep accounts, to detect when merchants were trying to cheat him, to speak smoothly and convincingly even when lying through his teeth.

That last skill came naturally. Giovanni discovered he had a gift for deception---not the crude lies of a common swindler, but the subtle half-truths and strategic omissions that characterized successful commerce. He could look a man in the eye and swear that their wine was the finest in Tuscany even while knowing it had been watered. Could promise delivery by the feast of San Marco while certain it would be a week late.

The ability troubled him at first. He had been raised to believe that lying was a sin, that God saw all deceptions and would punish them. But Marco laughed at his qualms.

'God gave you a tongue to speak and a mind to think,' the merchant said. 'If He didn't want you to use them cleverly, He wouldn't have made the world so full of fools waiting to be parted from their coin. Besides, we all lie, boy. The only difference is some of us are better at it than others.'

For three years Giovanni traveled with Marco, learning the routes and rhythms of Mediterranean trade. He saw Venice in all its glory---the canals and palaces, the markets where goods from the far reaches of the known world changed hands, the churches heavy with gold and the brothels heavy with sin. He saw Rome, where the Pope sat in splendor while beggars died in the streets. He saw Constantinople, that strange hybrid city where East met West and both came away changed.

And everywhere he went, he saw the Church.

Not the simple faith of his childhood, where the circuit priest blessed the fields and baptized babies and asked for little more than a chicken at Easter. This was the Church as a political force, as a repository of wealth and knowledge, as an institution that could make or break kingdoms. He saw bishops who lived like princes, monasteries that controlled vast estates, priests who whispered in the ears of kings.

He saw power. And he wanted it.

The revelation came to him in Venice, in one of the many churches that covered the city. He had ducked inside to escape a sudden rainstorm, stood dripping in the narthex while outside the sky opened and poured.

A service was in progress. The priest chanted in Greek, his voice echoing in the vault. Incense smoke curled through shafts of colored light from the high windows. The congregation knelt and rose, crossed themselves, murmured responses in a language Giovanni understood but had never heard used thus---ancient, formal, weighted with significance.

And Giovanni felt something shift in his chest. Not quite belief---he was too much the merchant for easy faith. But a recognition, perhaps. An understanding that here was power of a different kind than Marco wielded. Here was authority that needed no sword to enforce it, wealth that required no ledger to count.

When the service ended and the congregation filed out into the rain, Giovanni remained. The priest noticed him, approached with cautious charity---this young man in merchant's clothes, soaking wet and staring at the altar as if it held answers to questions he hadn't yet learned to ask.

'Can I help you, my son?' The priest spoke in Greek.

Giovanni answered in the same language. 'I want to join the Church.'

The priest's eyebrows rose. 'That's a significant decision. Have you felt a calling?'

Giovanni could have lied. Should have lied---should have claimed divine inspiration, a vision, a voice from heaven. But something in the priest's eyes, some quality of attention that seemed to see past facades, made him speak truth instead.

'I've felt ambition,' he said. 'I've felt the desire for learning, for purpose, for something more than the life of a merchant. If that's a calling, then yes. If not...' He shrugged. 'Then perhaps I'm wasting your time.'

The priest smiled. 'Honesty. That's rare. Most who come seeking the priesthood claim to be driven by pure devotion while secretly seeking exactly what you've named---position, education, escape from lesser circumstances.' He studied Giovanni thoughtfully. 'At least you know yourself. That's something. Come. Let's talk.'

They talked for three hours. The priest---his name was Renigius, and he would become Giovanni's closest friend and confidant---asked about Giovanni's background, his education, his reasons for wanting to enter the Church. And Giovanni, perhaps exhausted by years of careful lies in service of commerce, found himself speaking with unprecedented candor.

'I don't know if I believe,' he admitted. 'I've seen too much to accept the simple faith I was raised with. But I've also seen that the Church offers what no other institution can---a framework for meaning, a community that spans the world, access to knowledge that would otherwise be locked away. Even if I never achieve perfect faith, I think I could serve. And in serving, perhaps belief would come.'

Renigius nodded slowly. 'You're wrong about one thing. You do believe---just not in the simple way you were taught. Your faith is complicated, adult, tangled up with questions and doubts. That's not a weakness. It's often the mark of a faith that will last.'

And so Giovanni stayed in Venice. He sent word to Marco that he would not be continuing as a merchant, received a terse letter in reply wishing him well and warning him that the priesthood would eat him alive if he wasn't careful. He entered the local seminary as a novice, began the long process of transformation from merchant to man of God.

The training was rigorous. He studied theology and canon law, learned to read the Hebrew scriptures in their original tongue, absorbed commentaries on commentaries written by scholars long dead. He learned to chant the offices, to celebrate mass, to hear confession and offer absolution.

And he learned, slowly and with much struggle, to believe.

Not in the way of his childhood, with its certainties and its fear of hellfire. But in a more nuanced way---a recognition that there were powers at work in the world beyond human understanding, that grace was real even if its mechanisms were mysterious, that the structure and ritual of the Church served purposes both visible and invisible.

It was in his third year that he was summoned to the Monastery of Saint Severus, high in the Apennines where the winter winds howled like souls in torment. A brother there had been conducting services in a language that was not Latin, had been blessing the communion wine with signs that were not the cross. Giovanni arrived with two older priests and departed alone, three weeks later, carrying documents that would be sealed in the Vatican archives and a memory of what they had found in the crypt beneath the chapel—shapes pressed into the stone floor as if bodies had melted into it, and a smell that lingered in his robes for months afterward, sweet and rotten, like fruit left too long in a charnel house.

He was ordained at twenty-two, said his first mass with hands that shook only slightly. And discovered that he was good at this. Very good. His merchant's tongue, trained in persuasion, now turned those skills to homiletics. His ability to read people, honed in negotiations, served him well in the confessional. His education, broader than most country priests, allowed him to discuss matters of faith with nobles and scholars.

Within two years he had attracted the attention of the local bishop---not the titular bishop of the city, who was ancient and largely ceremonial, but Bishop Paulus, a younger man who actually ran the diocese. Paulus was brilliant, ruthless, and deeply committed to what he saw as the Church's mission. He recognized in Giovanni a kindred spirit.

'You're wasted hearing confessions and blessing bread,' Paulus told him. 'I need men who can think, who can act, who understand that the work of God is not always gentle. Are you willing to serve?'

Giovanni said yes. He always said yes to opportunity. It was both his greatest strength and his most fatal flaw.

Bishop Paulus's service involved tasks that were never discussed in seminary. There were negotiations with secular authorities that required both theological knowledge and political cunning. There were investigations of heresy that demanded the ability to detect lies and extract confessions. There were missions into dangerous territories, carrying messages or retrieving sacred relics or assessing threats.

And there were, occasionally, killings.

Not murders---Paulus was careful to make that distinction. The Church could order execution for heresy, for witchcraft, for crimes against God and the faithful. When civil authorities were unwilling or unable to carry out such sentences, the Church had to act through its own agents.

'Think of it as execution,' Paulus explained when he first broached the subject with Giovanni. 'No different than what the state does to common criminals. Except our criminals threaten not just the temporal order, but the eternal salvation of souls. Their elimination is a mercy to those they might corrupt.'

Giovanni's first killing was a man named Petros---a scholar who had been teaching that the material world was created not by God but by a lesser, evil deity, and that salvation lay in rejecting all physical existence. The heresy was spreading, drawing followers from among the educated classes. Petros had been warned, had recanted publicly, then returned to his teachings in secret.

The Church had tried him in absentia, found him guilty, sentenced him to death. But Petros had fled before he could be arrested, disappeared into the countryside surrounding Venice, where supporters could hide a fugitive for years.

Giovanni found him in three days. His merchant background served him well---he knew how to ask questions without raising suspicion, how to follow leads through markets and taverns. And his priesthood, and his peasant upbringing, gave him access to places and people that would have been closed to a lay investigator.

Petros was hiding in an outbuilding of a manor, sheltered by sympathizers who believed his teachings. Giovanni went there at night, dressed in plain clothes, carrying a knife blessed by Paulus himself.

He found Petros alone, reading by candlelight. The heretic looked up as Giovanni entered, and there was a moment---just a moment---when their eyes met and Petros understood what was about to happen.

'The Church sent you,' he said. Not a question.

'Yes,' Giovanni said.

'I've done nothing wrong. I teach only what I believe to be true.'

'That doesn't matter. The Church has judged you. I'm here to carry out the sentence.'

Petros didn't run. Didn't plead. He simply sat there, waiting, as if death were just another logical conclusion to be accepted.

Giovanni killed him quickly---a single thrust to the heart, the blade finding the gaps between ribs with a precision that surprised him. Petros gasped, slumped forward onto his book, and died.

Giovanni stood there for a long time, the bloody knife in his hand, looking at the corpse of the man he had just murdered in the name of God. He waited to feel guilt, horror, the crushing weight of mortal sin.

He felt nothing.

No, that wasn't quite true. He felt... satisfied. As if a problem had been solved, a task completed. The man had been spreading dangerous ideas. Now he wasn't. The world was marginally better for his absence.

Giovanni cleaned his blade, left the warehouse, and went to report to Paulus. The bishop received the news with a nod of approval.

'You did well. How do you feel?'

Giovanni considered lying, decided against it. 'Fine. I feel fine.'

Paulus smiled. 'Good. That means you understand. Some men are troubled by such work---they do it anyway, out of duty, but it eats at them. You're not one of those men. You see the necessity clearly. That makes you valuable.'

Over the next three years, Giovanni became Bishop Paulus's most effective agent. At first, he hunted heretics and witches, carried out sentences on behalf of the Church, eliminated threats to the Church's authority. He learned to move silently, to strike from shadow, to kill quickly and efficiently.

As time went on, though, more and more of his targets happened to be Bishop Paulus's rivals or enemies in Church politics; Paulus was clearly set on joining the College of Cardinals, or perhaps even being named Patriarch. When Giovanni asked Paulus one day about a particular target, Paulus waved aside his misgivings: 'Even if this man happens to be a rival of mine, don't you agree that he has no place in the Church?' The part of Giovanni that was broken, that felt no remorse for killing, was satisfied with the answer.

At the same time, he continued his duties as a priest---saying mass, hearing confessions, ministering to the faithful. The duality didn't trouble him. He saw both roles as serving the same ultimate purpose: protecting the Church and the souls in its care.

But there was a cost. Not to his conscience---that, if anything, grew more accommodating over time. The cost was to his humanity. He became harder, colder, more calculating. The easy charm of his merchant days remained, useful for manipulation. But beneath it, something essential had been excised.

Renigius noticed. 'You're changing,' he said one evening as they sat together in the church. 'I'm not sure I like what you're becoming.'

'I'm doing God's work,' Giovanni replied.

'Are you? Or are you doing Paulus's work and calling it God's?'

The question hung between them. Giovanni had no answer.

Finally, perhaps inevitably, Paulus overplayed his hand, and sent Giovanni to kill Ursus, Patriarch of Aquileia and an ally of the Pope. Giovanni never learned who betrayed Paulus, but when he snuck into the Patriarch's quarters that night, he found a rival assassin waiting for him. He barely escaped with his life, and fled from Venice that night.

He thought Constantinople would be far enough away, out of the direct control of the Papacy, but it wasn't long before hired knives found him, and he fled further east, eventually via the Silk Road, hoping to find somewhere beyond the anger and reach of the Church.
