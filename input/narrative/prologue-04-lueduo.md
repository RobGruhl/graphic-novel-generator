# Prologue IV: The Raven of the Emperor

*Being an Account of Lüèduó, Called Raven,*

*Late of the Taklamakan and the Court of the Dragon Throne*

In the wastes of the Taklamakan, where the sand whispers secrets to the patient and the mad, there dwelt a people who remembered darker things than death. The Uyghurs they were called, though among themselves they kept older names—names that spoke of wolf-lords and sky-fathers, of the princess who had lain with a great wolf and birthed a nation fierce and beautiful.

Among the black tents of the horse-clans, a child was born who would bear the name his people gave him only until darker powers claimed him for their own.

*Subject demonstrates unusual facility for the performative traditions. Apprenticed to clan shamans; focus appears artistic rather than spiritual. Unusual aptitude noted.*

*—Report to Ministry of Trade, Uyghur tribal records*

---

The shamans taught him the dances that were doorways. He learned them as a swordsman learns footwork—the movements mattered, the meaning did not. They showed him how to ward his mind when spirits pressed close during the fire-ceremonies, how to build walls inside his skull. Useful tricks for a performer who must lose himself in the dance without losing himself entirely.

He was seven when the oldest woman in the camp seized his wrist after a festival and wrenched his palm toward the firelight. Her grip was iron. Her eyes were milk.

*"Who was your mother's mother's mother?"*

He did not know. No one knew. The line was lost in the migrations that had scattered their people across the wasteland.

She spat into the fire. The flames hissed green.

*"Something old waits in you, boy. Fortune or ruin."* She released him with a shove that sent him stumbling. *"I cannot see which."*

That night he dreamed of coiling darkness, and woke with the taste of copper on his tongue.

By seventeen he had become beautiful in the way that draws the eye even as the mind recoils—high cheekbones, a mouth that curved cruel and kind by turns, hair black as a raven's wing falling straight to his shoulders. His eyes were golden-amber, and in certain lights the pupils seemed to shift.

The merchant's daughter was first. She came to his tent the night after a performance, her breath quick, her excuses thin. He took what she offered. Within a fortnight he had moved to the wife of a minor chief. Then a sister. Then a betrothed.

He did not think of it as seduction. He wanted, and reached, and they came to him like moths spiraling into flame.

The elders intervened too late. Behind him lay broken betrothals, blood-feuds kindling, a chief's youngest wife weeping in her tent. The chief himself demanded the boy's head on a spear.

The Tang army saved his life.

---

*Western Regions pacification proceeds. Local chieftains submitted; hostages taken per protocol. Among them, one youth of unusual qualities.*

*—Report to Ministry of War*

---

*"Take the dancer,"* the chief told the Tang officers, and did not trouble to hide his satisfaction. *"He is of good family. He will serve."*

The boy rode east in a wagon with the other hostages—sons of chiefs who glared and dreamed of escape. He alone watched the horizon with something like hunger.

At a rest stop, an officer demanded entertainment. The boy danced.

When he finished, the soldiers stood silent. Some had forgotten to breathe.

*"That one goes to the capital."*

---

*The Uyghur hostage has arrived. Initial assessment suggests exceptional aptitude for performance, language acquisition, and social manipulation. The majordomo has expressed interest.*

*—Report to Ministry of Rites*

---

He arrived as a war prize, one curiosity among dozens, destined to be sequestered and forgotten. During a ceremony where foreign hostages knelt before minor officials, he was meant to lower his eyes and be invisible.

Instead, he danced.

A few steps only—festival patterns adapted to the cramped space between kneeling bodies. But in the silence of that hall, before men who had seen every wonder the world could offer, those steps fell like stones into still water.

*"See how that raven-haired fellow moves. Who is he?"*

By midnight he performed for princes of the blood.

By dawn he had a new name.

*"Raven,"* the Emperor decreed. *"For his hair, and for the way he moves. Like a shadow with wings."*

---

What followed was a season of ascent.

Lüèduó rose from prisoner to performer, from performer to favorite. The nobility competed for his presence at their gatherings. He danced for ministers and generals, for concubines who watched from behind lacquered screens and whispered afterward in voices he was not meant to hear.

And he listened.

The court of the Dragon Throne was a garden of serpents, and Lüèduó moved through it with eyes open and ears sharp. He noted which minister's wife lingered too long at another man's pavilion. He observed which general's accounts did not balance, which merchant paid bribes to which customs officer, which prince's debts exceeded his allowance threefold. He catalogued jealousies and resentments, mapped the fault lines of old grudges, learned to read the micro-expressions that betrayed hidden allegiances.

The affairs began as opportunity. A minister's daughter, bored and curious about the exotic Uyghur, came to him after a performance. He took her in an alcove, her silks hiked to her waist, her moans muffled against his shoulder. Afterward, still trembling, she told him things—her father's private complaints about the Emperor's tax policies, the name of the concubine he kept in a house outside the palace walls.

Lüèduó filed the information away and moved on to the next.

A general's wife whose husband was campaigning in the west. She whispered of troop movements and supply shortages while he moved inside her. A merchant's widow who knew which warehouses held untaxed goods. The concubine of a prince who suspected her lord of planning rebellion and wanted someone—anyone—to tell.

He collected secrets the way other men collected jade. And he began to understand that information, properly leveraged, was worth more than gold.

---

*Subject has established connections throughout noble households. Access and discretion make him a potential asset. The majordomo concurs. Formal recruitment recommended.*

*—Report to Ministry of Rites*

---

The majordomo was a eunuch named Wei, risen through cunning to become one of the most powerful men in the Empire. He received Lüèduó in a chamber bare of ornament, lit by a single lamp.

*"You have been busy,"* Wei said. His voice was soft, almost gentle. *"Minister Chen's daughter. General Wu's wife. The Widow Fang."* He smiled. *"Also the shipping records from House Liang, the garrison rosters you copied from Commander Tsao's desk, and a rather detailed accounting of Prince Hui's gambling debts."*

Lüèduó kept his face still.

*"You thought no one noticed."* Wei's smile widened. *"I notice everything. It is what I do."*

*"Then you know I meant no harm to—"*

*"Harm?"* Wei waved the word away like smoke. *"You have been gathering intelligence on your own initiative, with no training, no handler, for your own advantage. This is either very foolish or very promising."* He leaned forward. *"I choose to believe it is promising. You have a gift for being where you should not be. For hearing what you should not hear. For making people tell you things they should not tell."*

*"My lord—"*

*"Such gifts can be cultivated."* Wei's eyes glittered in the lamplight. *"I am offering you cultivation. Training. Purpose. In exchange, you become my eyes in places I cannot go. My ears in conversations I am not invited to."*

Lüèduó considered. He had been operating blind, gathering secrets without knowing their value, taking risks for uncertain gain. What Wei offered was infrastructure. Direction. Protection.

He knelt. *"I am yours to command."*

The training was comprehensive and brutal.

Ciphers and codes—a dozen systems for encoding messages, each with its own use and context. Dead drops and signal patterns. The art of constructing a cover identity that would survive casual scrutiny and, with luck, something more thorough. How to read a room's loyalties in the first thirty seconds. How to identify the servant who could be bribed, the guard who was sleeping with his commander's wife, the merchant whose business was failing and who might therefore be desperate enough to talk.

He learned to maintain ledgers of obligation—who owed him favors, who owed him silence, who might prove useful in circumstances yet to arise. He learned the difference between intelligence that was interesting and intelligence that was actionable, between secrets that could be sold and secrets that must be hoarded.

And he continued his other work.

*"The Minister of Revenue's household,"* Wei said one evening, handing him a silk scroll. *"His new wife has been visiting a goldsmith in the western quarter. Find out why."*

Lüèduó found out. The wife was having jewelry made in secret—not for herself, but for her husband's enemies, as tokens of a conspiracy against the throne. The Minister knew nothing; his wife acted alone, nursing a grudge from before their marriage. The goldsmith vanished. The wife was quietly strangled. The Minister, none the wiser, remained loyal.

*"The Prince of Yue's trading company,"* Wei said another evening. *"Their accounts show profit, but their ships return half-empty. Learn what fills the missing space."*

The missing space was filled with alchemical ingredients banned by Imperial decree—substances used in the manufacture of immortality elixirs, smuggled from southern ports. The Prince was building a laboratory beneath his country estate, pursuing forbidden experiments in defiance of the Emperor's explicit prohibition. Lüèduó mapped the network, identified the suppliers, documented the transactions. The information went into Wei's files, to be deployed when the moment was right.

There were dozens of such assignments. Trade irregularities that concealed embezzlement. Love affairs that created vulnerabilities. Feuds between noble houses that might be exploited or contained. Lüèduó moved through the court like a ghost, dancing by night and spying by day, building a web of knowledge that grew more intricate with each passing month.

He did not always understand the purpose. Sometimes Wei asked for information that seemed trivial—the name of a minister's favorite wine, the schedule of a general's morning exercises, the color of the ribbons a certain lady wore in her hair. But Lüèduó had learned not to question. Everything was connected. Everything mattered. And if he could not see the pattern, that only meant the pattern was larger than he could yet perceive.

---

*Subject's activities have attracted attention. Minister Zhang has filed complaints regarding his wife. Matter requires delicate handling.*

*—Report to Ministry of Rites*

---

Her name was Lady Mei.

She was the second wife of Minister Zhang, a man of immense wealth who sat on the Council of State and commanded the Emperor's ear on matters of commerce. She was also beautiful, bored, and possessed of appetites her elderly husband could not satisfy.

Lüèduó should have known better.

Their first encounter was at a banquet celebrating the autumn harvest. She watched him dance from behind her screen, her dark eyes following every movement. Afterward, when the other guests had departed, she found him in the gardens.

*"You move like water,"* she said. *"Like something not entirely human."*

*"My lady is kind."*

*"My lady is curious."* She stepped closer. The moonlight caught the jade ornaments in her hair, the curve of her throat above her silk collar. *"They say you have bedded half the women at court. Is this true?"*

*"Rumors exaggerate."*

*"Do they?"* Her hand found his chest, fingers splaying over the thin fabric of his robe. *"I find myself wanting to know if the rumors do you justice."*

He took her there, in the garden, against a pillar carved with dragons. Her nails raked his back as she gasped his name. When they finished, she laughed—a low, throaty sound—and kissed him with a hunger that promised more to come.

There was more.

Three months of stolen hours. Her chambers when the Minister was at court. A pavilion by the lotus pond. Once, recklessly, in an antechamber while her husband entertained guests in the next room—her hand over her own mouth to stifle her cries while Lüèduó moved inside her.

She was insatiable. And he, *fool* that he was, was flattered.

The night it ended, she lay beneath him, her hair unbound across silk pillows. His hand was tangled in that hair, his body moving against hers, her moans grown too loud for caution—

The door opened.

Minister Zhang stood flanked by guards with drawn swords. His face was carved from ice.

Lüèduó rolled away, reaching for his robe. Lady Mei scrambled for the sheets, her face bloodless.

*"Husband—"*

*"Silence."*

Zhang stepped forward, silk slippers whispering on stone. His eyes moved from his wife's naked body to Lüèduó with the assessment of a man examining an insect.

*"Take her to the western courtyard,"* he told the guards. *"She knows what awaits."*

Lady Mei screamed as they seized her. She reached for Lüèduó—a desperate, futile gesture—but he could only watch as they dragged her away. Her screams echoed down the corridor. Then silence.

Zhang turned back to Lüèduó.

*"You will confess of every woman you have defiled under this roof. You will name them. And then you will die slowly, in ways that will make you envy my wife's fate."*

---

*URGENT: Minister Zhang demands execution. The majordomo has intervened. Resolution pending.*

*—Report to Ministry of Rites*

---

The audience chamber was empty save for three: the Emperor on his throne, Wei at his side, Lüèduó on his knees.

*"Minister Zhang wants your head,"* the Emperor said. *"He is valuable. His support is important."*

*"Yes, Majesty."*

*"Do not grovel. It bores me."* The Emperor's eyes were hooded, unreadable. *"The majordomo tells me you have skills beyond seducing other men's wives. He tells me you might still be useful."*

Wei stepped forward. *"There are reports from the western territories, Majesty. Disturbances near the old trade routes. Something interfering with our forces. The local commanders speak of sorcery—soldiers who vanish, caravans found empty with no sign of attack."*

*"Ah."* The Emperor's mouth curved. *"And you propose we send this one to investigate."*

*"He knows the western lands. He has training. And if he fails—"* Wei's smile was thin as a blade. *"Minister Zhang will be satisfied."*

*"Killing two birds."* The Emperor nodded. *"Go, then. Die usefully if you can. And Raven—"* He leaned forward. *"Do not return without something of value. My patience has limits."*

---

The journey west took him back along the Silk Road, through cities he had passed in chains. He traveled as a merchant, documents impeccable, another trader seeking fortune in distant lands.

But as he neared the region Wei had described, something changed.

It began as a whisper at the edge of hearing—a voice that was not a voice, speaking words that were not words. A pressure behind his eyes when he tried to sleep. Dreams of geometries that hurt to remember.

The protective techniques the shamans had taught him—rote exercises, unused for years—suddenly mattered. He reinforced mental barriers he had nearly forgotten how to build. Something was testing him, probing for weakness, and the tests grew stronger with each mile west.

The locals called it the *Serpent's Rest.*

Tumbled walls rose from the sand, half-buried, their architecture wrong in ways Lüèduó could not name. The angles did not meet as angles should. The doorways were too tall, too narrow, proportioned for bodies that were not human. The stone was black, veined with something that pulsed faintly in the moonlight—not quite phosphorescence, not quite life.

The Tang soldiers sent to investigate had not returned. Neither had the second detachment, nor the third.

Lüèduó entered alone.

The passage descended. The walls pressed close, slick with moisture that should not exist in the desert, and the air grew thick with a sweetness like honey left to rot. His torch guttered and dimmed, its light swallowed by darkness that seemed to have weight.

Then the passage opened, and he saw.

The chamber was vast—too vast, impossibly vast, larger than the ruins above could possibly contain. Columns rose into darkness without end, carved with forms that writhed at the edge of vision, that seemed to move when he looked away. The floor was covered with something that crackled underfoot—bones, he realized, a carpet of bones from creatures he could not identify, skulls too elongated, ribcages that curved wrong, vertebrae that suggested spines which bent in directions flesh should not bend.

At the chamber's heart, something waited.

It wore the shape of a woman the way a hand wears a glove—a convenience, a tool, nothing more. Dark hair coiled and moved without wind. Skin pale as moonlight on snow, but with a texture beneath the surface, a suggestion of scales that rippled when she breathed. Eyes golden, with pupils that were vertical slits, and behind those pupils something looked out that was older than the desert, older than the mountains, older than the stars.

She smiled, and Lüèduó's knees buckled.

Not from fear—though fear was there, vast and primal. His body simply refused to support him in her presence. He fell, and the impact of bone on stone seemed to come from very far away.

*You are not what I expected.*

The voice was inside his skull, inside his spine, inside the marrow of his bones. It resonated in frequencies that made his teeth ache and his vision swim.

*The soldiers they sent were hollow. Empty vessels making noise. But you—*

She moved toward him. Not walking—gliding, flowing, her lower body lost in shadow that moved with her like a train of living darkness. The closer she came, the harder it was to breathe. The air itself seemed to thicken, to resist his lungs.

*There are walls in your mind. Crude. A child's construction.* He felt her attention pressing against his barriers, felt them groan under the weight. *But they hold. How interesting. And beneath them—*

She stopped. Her head tilted at an angle that no human neck should permit.

*Something sings in your blood. Something that knows me.*

*"What—"* His voice was a croak. *"What are you?"*

*I am Nagini. I am what was worshipped in temples beneath the sand when your ancestors still crawled in caves. I am what waits in the spaces between worlds.*

She extended her hand. Her fingers were too long, the joints too many, and as he watched, they seemed to lengthen further, seemed to multiply—

*They sent you to die, little raven. But death is wasteful. I see better uses for you.*

He should have fled. Every instinct screamed at him to run, to crawl, to do anything but remain in this creature's presence. But his body would not obey. And somewhere beneath the terror, beneath the revulsion, something in him recognized her. Something reached toward her the way a flower reaches toward the sun.

*Yes,* she breathed. *You feel it. The old blood, waking. You did not know what you carried, but I know. I have always known.*

Her hand touched his face.

The contact was—

—scales sliding across his skin, cold and dry and somehow electric—

—a sensation of something entering him through the touch, through his eyes, through his pores—

—pain, exquisite and total, as if his blood had been replaced with molten silver—

—and then visions, hammering into his mind faster than thought:

Serpent-cities beneath the earth, their spires reaching down into darkness without end. Beings that were not gods but might as well have been, coiled around the roots of mountains, dreaming dreams that lasted millennia. A war fought before mammals walked the earth, before the continents took their current shapes, a war whose echoes still rippled through reality like rings spreading across a pond. And threading through it all, a single bloodline—diluted, scattered, nearly lost—carrying a spark of something that had survived the war, something that waited to be rekindled.

His bloodline.

*You are mine,* the Nagini whispered, and her voice was the voice from his childhood dreams, the voice he had heard without hearing since the night the old woman spat into the fire. *You have always been mine. I simply had to wait for you to ripen.*

Lüèduó screamed.

The sound echoed through the impossible chamber, bounced off columns that should not exist, was swallowed by darkness that should not be. He screamed until his throat tore, until blood flecked his lips, until consciousness itself began to fray—

And then, mercifully, there was nothing.

---

He woke in sand.

Dawn light spilled across empty desert. The ruins were gone—not collapsed, not buried, simply absent, as if they had never been. He lay in a shallow depression that might have been natural, might have been the impression left by a body that had lain there for hours.

On his wrist, two puncture marks wept clear fluid.

In his mind, coiled in a space that had not existed before, something waited. Watching. Patient.

*We will speak again,* the Nagini murmured. *When you have had time to understand. When you have need of what I offer.*

He tried to answer, but his throat was raw, his voice gone.

*Go west, little raven. There are others whose paths will cross yours. Broken souls. Useful souls. You will know them when you find them.*

Then she was gone—not departed, not withdrawn, simply quiet. A presence at the back of his mind like a door left slightly ajar, through which anything might enter if he let it.

Lüèduó rose on shaking legs. He looked at the empty desert where ancient walls had stood. He looked at his wrist, where the puncture marks were already beginning to scar.

He did not return to the Dragon Throne.

---

*The agent designated "Raven" has not returned from assignment. Status presumed deceased. Minister Zhang is satisfied. File closed.*

*—Final Report to Ministry of Rites*

---

He wandered the western lands.

The Nagini came in dreams, teaching secrets no mortal should know. He learned to see through illusions, to taste lies on the air, to move in ways that defied flesh. The power in his blood woke further with each lesson—his eyes shifting to vertical slits when he lost focus, his skin taking on an iridescent sheen in certain lights.

The Emperor's agents sought him. Reports filtered along the Silk Road—a Uyghur dancer with strange eyes, a merchant who appeared and vanished like smoke. But the west was vast, and Lüèduó had learned to move like a shadow.

The game began at sunset and should have ended at midnight. Lüèduó had entered the caravanserai's common room with modest intentions—a few hands of cards, perhaps some dice, enough to pass the evening hours before sleep. He carried coin enough for such diversions, winnings from a merchant who had foolishly challenged him in Kashgar, and he had no particular need for more.

But the first throw of the dice went his way, and then the second, and by the time the moon rose, he had tripled his stake.

*Walk away,* the serpent-voice whispered in his blood. *You have enough. Walk away.*

He did not walk away.

The cards turned in his favor next—a string of hands so improbable that the other players began to mutter about cheating, though Lüèduó's supernatural gifts gave him no advantage here. This was pure chance, pure chaos, and it sang to something in his soul that he could not name. He played and won, won and played, and the pile of coins before him grew until it exceeded what most merchants earned in a season.

Then the dice turned.

It happened gradually at first—a loss here, a near-miss there—but Lüèduó recognized the pattern even as he failed to break free of it. His winnings bled away one bet at a time, and each loss demanded another wager to recoup what had been taken. He could feel the compulsion like a physical weight, like chains wrapped around his chest, and still he could not stop.

By dawn, he had lost everything he had won and everything he had carried into the room. His purse was empty. His saddlebags had been wagered and claimed. His spare clothes, his traveling supplies, his carefully hoarded provisions—all gone, scattered among players who had watched his rise and fall with the dispassionate attention of wolves watching a wounded deer.

Only three things remained: the pear crystal, which he had refused to wager even in his deepest fever; his sketchbook, which no one had wanted; and the clothes on his back.

He walked out of the caravanserai into the breaking day, penniless and strangely at peace. The fever had passed. The compulsion had released him—for now.

*You are a fool,* the serpent-voice observed.

*"Yes,"* Lüèduó agreed. *"But I am a fool who still possesses the only things that matter."*

He would rebuild. He always did. But in that moment, watching the sun rise over mountains he could not name, he allowed himself to feel the weight of what he was—not merely a man with serpent blood, but a creature of contradictions, capable of discipline and yet enslaved to hungers he could not control.

The road stretched westward. He began to walk.

---

He found the Norseman in a village that had no name worth remembering.

The man was impossible to miss—nearly seven feet of scarred muscle, face hidden behind a helm of blackened steel that seemed fused to a collar around his throat. He sat beside a cold forge, repairing a farmer's plow with hands that moved with surprising delicacy.

Lüèduó watched from shadow for an hour before approaching.

*"You are far from home,"* he said in the trade-tongue.

The Norseman looked up. Through the spherical helm's many holes, pale blue eyes regarded him with an intensity that would have made lesser men flinch.

*"So are you."* The voice was rough. *"What do you want?"*

*"I am in need of a sellsword."* He gestured at the six feet of forged steel strapped to Eskil's back. *"You are one of them."*

The Norseman was silent. Then, slowly, he set down the plow and rose—and kept rising, until he towered over Lüèduó like a siege engine made flesh.

*"Tell me why."*

*"Something is coming. Something that will require more than I can face alone."*

*"And you think we should face it together."*

*"I have a sense we would cross paths whether we choose to or not—something told me so. The only question is whether we do so as strangers or as allies."*

The Norseman considered. Something flickered behind his eyes—memory, perhaps, or calculation.

*"I am Eskil. Of a place that no longer exists. I am cursed, and hunted, and dangerous to those who travel with me."*

Lüèduó smiled—a genuine smile, unmarred by calculation.

*"I am Lüèduó. Called Raven. I am also cursed, also hunted, and far more dangerous than you realize."* He extended his hand. *"It seems we have much in common."*

Eskil's grip was surprisingly gentle.

*"There is a caravan gathering in Samarkand. A merchant named Hind seeks guards for the western crossing. She does not ask too many questions."*

*"Samarkand,"* Eskil repeated.

*"It is on the way to everywhere."*

The Norseman gathered his tools, his forge, the few possessions that comprised his life.

They departed at dawn.

---

Thus ends this account of Lüèduó's early years. What follows—his meeting with the others, his battles against the horrors that haunt the Silk Road, his entanglement with powers beyond mortal comprehension—that tale must wait for another time.

For now, it is enough to know that he walks the earth still: a figure of shadow and scales, forever hunted and forever hunting.
