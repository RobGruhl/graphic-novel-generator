# Episode IV: Shiraz and the Sea
## Chapter Ten: The Red Sea

The ships of Soleman were Persian in construction, their hulls sewn together with coconut fiber in the manner of vessels that plied the Arabian Sea. There were no proper decks—palm fronds covered the cargo, and the passengers made themselves as comfortable as they could among the bales of silk and sacks of spices that filled every available space.

Hind's caravan was split across several vessels, the animals and goods distributed to maintain balance and minimize the risk of total loss should one ship founder. The party found themselves aboard the largest of the dhows, sharing space with merchants from a dozen nations and sailors whose songs spoke of the dangers that lurked in the waters they would traverse.

The stars overhead were different from those that had guided them across the steppes and mountains. Southern constellations rose above the horizon, their patterns unfamiliar, their light somehow older than the stars of northern skies. Giovanni spent hours studying them, searching for meaning in their arrangements, finding nothing but beauty and mystery.

And Eskil dreamed.

He saw Karishkir in the darkness behind his eyes—her face too close, her mouth too wide, her teeth dripping with the blood of victims beyond counting. She spoke to him in a voice that seemed to bypass his ears entirely, resonating directly in the marrow of his bones.

"I know how to convey a message to your brother," she said. "Do you want me to tell him something?"

In the dream, Eskil could feel Leif's presence—the iron skull that hung at his belt, the consciousness of his murdered brother that sometimes spoke to him. Leif was trying to warn him of something, trying to break through the barriers that separated the living from the dead, but Karishkir's power was too great.

"I have him," the witch continued, and her smile was the smile of a predator who knows its prey cannot escape. "And we will have you."

Eskil cursed her in the tongue of his ancestors, called upon powers that he barely understood, rejected her with every fiber of his being—

And woke to find Sadia standing over him, her hand on her sword, her expression caught between concern and wariness.

"You were swearing in your sleep," she said. "And you're drenched in sweat."

Eskil sat up too quickly, his massive frame nearly knocking Sadia off her feet as she stumbled backward over a bale of cargo. He caught her arm, steadied her, released her as soon as she had her balance.

"A dream," he said. "Nothing more."

Sadia did not believe him—that much was clear from her expression—but she did not press. She had her own secrets, her own nightmares. Perhaps she understood that some things were better left unspoken.

The voyage continued.

They stopped briefly in Yemen, where the spice markets offered goods that could not be found elsewhere in the world. Sadia went ashore to find a watering hole—any excuse to be off the ship that she clearly despised—and returned looking somewhat less murderous than she had before.

The sailors sang as they worked, songs of the Red Sea and its dangers—reefs that could tear the bottom from an unwary vessel, pirates who preyed on merchant ships, sea creatures of such size that they could swallow a dhow whole. Nothing attacked them. The winds were favorable, the currents cooperative, and the fleet made good time.

But the dreams did not stop. And each night, Karishkir's face grew clearer, her voice more insistent, her promises more terrible.

"We will have you," she whispered. "In the end, we will have you all."

Eskil did not tell the others. He bore the burden alone, as he had borne so many burdens, trusting that when the time came to face Karishkir again, he would find the strength to destroy her—or die trying.

The coast of Egypt rose from the horizon like a promise and a threat.

And somewhere ahead, in temples buried beneath the sands, in tombs that had waited since before the pharaohs built their pyramids, answers awaited.

Whether those answers would bring salvation or damnation remained to be seen.
