# Episode IV: Shiraz and the Sea
## Chapter Nine: The Library of the Dead

It was Paul who brought them to the trap.

The former slave—if that was what he truly was—had integrated himself into the rhythms of caravan life with suspicious ease. He was helpful, eager to please, always ready with a smile and a word of gratitude for Father Giovanni. He claimed to know Shiraz well from his years of servitude, and he offered to guide the party through the city's labyrinthine streets whenever they had business to conduct.

He mentioned, one evening, that he knew a wealthy man who possessed a book.

"Symbols," Paul said, his dark eyes fixed on Eskil with an intensity that should have raised suspicions. "Strange symbols, like the ones I have seen on your... writings. The markings you and the scholars study."

Eskil looked up from the fragments he had been examining with Abu-Rayhan and Isaac. "What wealthy man? What book?"

"His name is Kerdir. A collector of antiquities, a man of learning. He has a library—small, but containing texts that are not found elsewhere. I could arrange a meeting, if you wished."

The party debated. Wealthy Persians did not typically welcome armed strangers into their homes. But the possibility of finding texts that could illuminate the mysteries they pursued was too tempting to ignore.

"We will go," Giovanni decided. "But we will go quietly, and we will go carefully."

Paul smiled that smile again—the one that should have warned them—and said he would make the arrangements.

---

The house of Kerdir was located in one of Shiraz's older quarters, a district where the homes of the wealthy stood behind high walls and iron gates, where servants should have been bustling about their evening duties. But as Paul led them through the streets, Giovanni noticed something troubling.

There were no servants.

The houses they passed were dark, their windows shuttered, their gates locked. No voices drifted from behind the walls, no sounds of cooking or conversation or the thousand small noises that marked the presence of human habitation. The street was silent in a way that made the hair on Giovanni's neck stand on end.

He said nothing. Perhaps he was being paranoid. Perhaps the wealthy of Shiraz simply kept different hours than the merchants and laborers.

But he loosened a dagger in its sheath, and he saw that the others had made similar preparations.

Paul led them to a gate that stood slightly ajar, pushed it open, and gestured for them to enter. Beyond lay a courtyard of typical Persian design—a fountain at its center, now still and silent, surrounded by tiled walkways and doors that led to the various chambers of the house. Lamps had been lit, casting pools of yellow light that did nothing to dispel the sense of abandonment that pervaded the place.

"The library is upstairs," Paul said. "Master Kerdir will be waiting."

They climbed. The stairs were marble, worn smooth by generations of feet, and they creaked beneath Eskil's weight in a way that seemed almost accusatory. The upper floor was a corridor lined with doors, at the end of which stood an entrance flanked by bookshelves visible through the opening.

Giovanni's instincts were screaming now. "Where is Kerdir?" he demanded. "Where are his servants?"

Paul's smile widened, and something in that smile was no longer human.

"Master Kerdir is resting," he said. "Permanently."

He pushed open the door to the library—

And Kerdir was there, slumped in a chair before a writing desk, his skin blue-white with the cold of death, his eyes open and staring at nothing. Frost rimmed his lips and eyelashes. Ice crystals had formed in his beard.

"He was delicious," Paul said, and his mouth opened to reveal fangs where human teeth should have been.

The attack came from two directions at once.

Paul lunged for Giovanni, moving with speed that no mortal frame should have possessed. At the same moment, a woman emerged from behind a bookshelf—beautiful, dark-haired, her features bearing a striking resemblance to Paul's own. His sister, Giovanni realized in the fraction of a second before her claws raked across his throat.

Blood fountained. Giovanni staggered back, his hands rising to the wound, feeling the hot pulse of his life pouring out between his fingers. The woman had torn through muscle and sinew with surgical precision, opening his carotid artery, severing his voice so that he could not even scream.

He fell.

Chaos erupted in the library.

Eskil's war-blade sang its prayer of deliverance as he swung at Paul—but the creature was no longer where he had been, dissolving into a swarm of rats that scattered across the floor in a chittering tide. The Norseman's stroke passed through empty air.

Bansi engaged the sister, her new scimitar meeting claws that sparked against the steel. The woman was fast, impossibly fast, but Bansi had trained for exactly this kind of opponent—enemies who relied on speed rather than strength, who expected to overwhelm through aggression. She gave ground deliberately, drawing the creature into overextending, waiting for an opening.

Lüèduó dropped to his knees beside Giovanni, his hands pressing against the priest's throat, trying to staunch the bleeding that was painting the library's floor in spreading crimson.

"Help him!" he shouted. "Someone help him!"

The sister's head whipped toward the sound, her attention diverted for a fraction of a second—and Eskil's blade caught her across the back as she turned. It was not a killing blow, but it staggered her, sent her stumbling forward into Bansi's waiting steel. The scimitar took her through the chest.

She should have died. Any mortal creature would have died.

Instead, she laughed.

Her hands closed around the blade embedded in her body, and she *pulled*, sliding herself along the steel until she was face to face with Bansi, close enough that the thief could smell the rot on her breath.

"Foolish child," the sister whispered. "You cannot kill what is already dead."

Eskil's second stroke took her head off at the neck.

For a moment, it seemed that this would end it. The body collapsed, the head rolled away across the floor, and the sister was surely destroyed. But then the headless corpse began to move, its hands groping across the tiles, searching for its severed head.

"Fire!" Isaac shouted. He had been standing frozen in the doorway, his scholarly mind struggling to process the horror unfolding before him. But now he acted, pulling a lamp from its bracket and hurling it at the crawling body. Oil splashed across the corpse, and flames erupted.

The sister burned. Her body thrashed and writhed, and a shriek emerged from her severed head—a sound of rage more than pain—before she and her brother both dissolved into whirlwinds of dust that spiraled upward and out through the library's high windows, fleeing into the night.

And Giovanni was dying.

---

Lüèduó cradled the priest's head in his lap, his hands slick with blood, his serpent-nature recoiling from the smell of death that was gathering around his friend. Bansi had torn strips from her own clothing and was pressing them against the wound, but the blood kept coming, soaking through layer after layer of cloth.

"We need to move him," Bansi said. "Back to the caravan."

"He won't survive the journey," Lüèduó said flatly. "We need to bind this now."

Abu-Rayhan knelt beside them, his physician's training taking over despite the terror that made his hands shake. He examined the wound with quick, professional movements.

"The artery is severed," he reported. "If we can bind it, apply pressure, keep him from moving—he might live. But it will leave a scar that he will carry forever."

"Do it," Lüèduó said. "Whatever it takes."

Abu-Rayhan worked. He used supplies from his medical kit—needle and thread, bandages soaked in wine to prevent corruption—and he stitched the wound with the concentration of a man whose entire world had narrowed to the task before him. Giovanni was unconscious now, his breathing shallow, his skin pale beneath its Mediterranean olive.

When it was done, they carried him between them through the darkened streets of Shiraz, moving as quickly as they dared without jostling the priest too badly. The city seemed to hold its breath around them, and Giovanni's blood left a trail that would not wash away until the autumn rains.

Hind met them at the edge of the encampment. She took one look at Giovanni's pallid face, the bandages already seeping red, and began shouting orders.

"Summon the healer! Prepare the surgical kit! Bring me opium for the pain!"

The healer—an old man whose hands had stitched a thousand wounds in his years of service to Hind's caravans—examined Abu-Rayhan's work and nodded with grim approval.

"The binding is good. But the wound must be sewn properly if he is to survive." He turned to Giovanni, who had regained consciousness and was watching through half-lidded eyes. "I can give you opium for the pain."

"No." Giovanni's voice was barely a whisper, but his tone was firm. "I will... I will accept the hurt. It is... proper penance."

The healer shrugged—he had seen men choose suffering before—and began his work with animal sinew and curved needle. Giovanni did not cry out as the thread passed through his flesh, but his hands gripped the sides of the cot hard enough to whiten his knuckles, and sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cool of the evening.

When it was done, the healer bound the wound with clean linen and stepped back.

"He will live," the man pronounced. "If infection does not take hold. If he does not tear the stitches. If his God shows mercy."

Giovanni's lips moved in silent prayer. Perhaps his God was listening. Perhaps not. But he was alive, and that was more than the creatures that had attacked him had intended.

---

While the healer worked, the others gathered in Hind's pavilion to discuss what had happened.

Isaac spoke first, his scholar's mind already racing through the implications of what they had witnessed.

"I have heard tales of such creatures," he said. "In the libraries of my order, there are texts that speak of beings who drink not blood alone, but the very essence of their victims. The soul, perhaps. The life-force. Whatever term one prefers." He shook his head. "The swarm of rats, the cloud of dust—these are said to be among their many powers. They cannot be killed by blade alone."

"Then how?" Bansi demanded. "How do we destroy them completely?"

"I will have to search. There are methods—fire, certain holy symbols, wood from specific trees—but the texts are contradictory, and I do not know which accounts can be trusted." Isaac spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness. "I will research. But I can promise nothing."

Hind's expression was grim. "This attack changes things. If these creatures targeted your group specifically—if they knew you would come to that house—then you have enemies in Shiraz. Enemies who will not rest until you are destroyed."

She let that sink in before continuing.

"I have spoken with Soleman, the merchant whose slave Paul claimed to be. He is... concerned. Two bodies were found in his household this morning, cold as ice, drained of all vitality. His true slave Hassan and a maidservant. Their corpses match the descriptions of the creatures who attacked you."

"The vampires were wearing their faces," Lüèduó said. Understanding dawned cold and terrible. "They killed Soleman's servants, assumed their identities, and waited for an opportunity to strike at us."

"At Giovanni specifically," Bansi observed. "The woman went for his throat first. As if she knew exactly who to target."

Why Giovanni? The priest was dangerous, certainly, but no more so than Eskil or Bansi or any of the others. Unless...

"They are connected to Karishkir," Eskil said. The certainty in his voice surprised even him. "The witch from Merv. She survived the battle in the bone chapel. She and her servant Drekhlo—they fled through some dark portal. These vampires serve the same masters."

It made a horrible kind of sense. Karishkir had reason to hate them all, but especially Giovanni—the priest whose faith had anchored them during the horror beneath Merv, whose prayers had perhaps been the crucial element in their survival.

"Whether that is true or not," Hind said, "you cannot remain in Shiraz. The emir's men will investigate the deaths at Kerdir's house. If they connect those deaths to foreigners in my caravan—" She drew a finger across her throat. "We would all decorate the city walls."

"Where do we go?" Giovanni had appeared in the pavilion's entrance, supported by Lüèduó, his throat swathed in bandages. His voice was a damaged rasp, painful to hear. "We cannot simply... flee without purpose."

"Soleman has offered an alternative." Hind's tone suggested she was not entirely pleased with this development. "His ships are preparing to sail for Egypt. He will transport our caravan—free of charge—if we leave Shiraz immediately and take our troubles with us."

"And if we refuse?"

"Then he will ensure the emir learns exactly who was present at Kerdir's house tonight. He wants you gone, Giovanni. You have brought something dark into his city, and he will do whatever is necessary to cleanse it."

There was no choice, really. They all knew it.

"Egypt," Bansi said, testing the word. "I have never seen the pyramids."

"Nor I," Lüèduó admitted. "Though I hear the markets of Cairo are magnificent."

Eskil said nothing. His attention was fixed on the book he had taken from Kerdir's library in the chaos of their escape—a slim volume bound in leather of suspicious origin, its pages covered in symbols that made his head ache and his blood sing.

"There is something else," he said quietly. "Something we found in the library, before the attack."

He brought the book to where Isaac and Abu-Rayhan sat and opened it to a marked page. Both scholars leaned forward, their eyes widening as they recognized what they were seeing.

"Stygian," Abu-Rayhan said, "but with symbols I do not know interspersed throughout. And notes—marginal annotations, hastily written, as if the previous reader was desperate to record their thoughts before they were lost."

Isaac's intake of breath was sharp. "This is a translation guide. Or the beginning of one. 'The guide and goal of the sage who wishes to read in the Khem-Sethi tongue.'" He looked up at the others, his face pale. "The Khem-Sethis were an ancient people. Their cities lie buried beneath the sands of what we now call Egypt. This book—this could allow us to read the fragments we recovered in Merv."

"Is that wise?" Giovanni asked. His voice was barely audible, his throat clearly paining him. "The fragments... we know not what they contain. Eskil has warned us—"

"Knowledge is neither good nor evil," Isaac said. "It is how one uses knowledge that determines its moral weight. If we can read these fragments, we may learn something of the forces arrayed against us. We may find weapons to use in our defense."

The debate continued, but in the end, curiosity won out over caution. They gathered around the translation guide and the fragments, working by lamplight through the small hours of the night, piecing together meaning from symbols that human minds were never meant to comprehend.

The Stygian tongue revealed itself reluctantly, fighting against translation as if the very concepts it expressed resisted being rendered in Arabic or Latin or any language designed for human throats. But slowly, word by word, phrase by phrase, understanding emerged.

"Amulet," Abu-Rayhan read, his finger tracing a line of text. "Khem-Sethi. Serpents. Things from beyond. Interstices." He paused, frowning. "What is an interstice?"

"The spaces between," Isaac replied. "The gaps between what is and what should be. In certain mystical traditions, the interstices are where the truly alien beings dwell—too different from our reality to exist fully within it, but able to reach through from their side."

"Crawling passages forgotten beneath sands," Abu-Rayhan continued. "Beneath tombs. A book—*Towaif tu lusaf*—the name means something like 'unspeakable' or 'unnameable.' Cults that worship powers too terrible to be spoken of openly."

"That is the Book of Eibon," Isaac said, his voice dropping to nearly a whisper. "A tome of such antiquity that it was composed in the Hyperborean language of Tsath-Yo, before Atlantis rose from the sea. It contains knowledge of the outer beings, of the powers that ruled this world before humanity existed. If there is a copy of that book in Egypt..."

He did not finish the thought. He did not need to.

"There is something else," Abu-Rayhan said. "A place-name. 'Irem.'" He spelled it out in Arabic characters. "The Pillars of Irem. It is said to be a city of impossible age, hidden in the deserts of Arabia, where the Mad Arab himself once walked. The fragments suggest a connection between this city and the Stygian temples buried beneath Egypt."

Irem. The City of Pillars, which dreams hidden and untouched in the pathless deserts, where the center of cults devoted to powers beyond human comprehension was said to lie. A place that Abdul Alhazred, author of the dread Necronomicon, had claimed to visit before madness claimed him.

The fragments they had carried from Merv, the translation guide from Kerdir's library, the amulet that Lüèduó carried in its runed and scorched containment—all of them were connected. Threads in a tapestry that was only beginning to reveal its pattern.

And that pattern led to Egypt.

Gan arrived as dawn was breaking.

She had been absent for days, riding out onto the steppes that lay beyond Shiraz's walls, seeking communion with the spirits of her people. The shamans who wandered those grasslands were distant kin of her own tribe, practitioners of a mysticism that predated the religions that had swept across Asia in the centuries since the Buddha walked the earth.

She looked exhausted—dark circles beneath her eyes, her hair tangled and unwashed, her clothing stained with travel. But there was something else in her expression, something that made the others fall silent as she entered Hind's pavilion.

"I have news for you," she said without preamble.

She told them of the spirit trance. Of the yurt that had stood alone on the steppe, smoke rising from herbs that opened doors between worlds. Of the visions that had come to her in the darkness between heartbeats.

"I saw Karishkir. I saw Drekhlo. I saw them together with the Khan of the Nine Skulls."

The name meant nothing to most of them, but Hind's expression darkened with recognition.

"A warlord of the northern steppes," she explained. "A man who has united several of the nomad tribes under his banner through a combination of conquest and dark sorcery. He rules from a fortress on the banks of the Itil—the great river that the Greeks called the Rha, and that flows into the sea the Persians name Khazar."

"The Volga," Eskil said. Among his people, the river was known as a highway for trade and raiding, a path that led from the frozen north to the warm waters of the Caspian. "Sometimes the Norsemen sail down it from the far north to the trading posts there."

Gan nodded. "I saw a town built of wood with a palisade on the great river. Itil. It is held by the khan of the Bulgars, but Karishkir and Drekhlo were there, meeting with the Khan of the Nine Skulls. Something is gathering on the banks of the river. Something is being planned."

She paused, and when she spoke again, her voice was troubled.

"There was one more thing. Drekhlo—the tattoos on his body, the ones that writhed in Merv—they were still moving. Even in my vision, even separated by who knows how many leagues, I could see them shifting on his skin like living things."

Eskil shook his head slowly, his expression grim.

"He has opened himself," the Norseman said. "He has given more of himself to the powers he serves, invited them deeper into his flesh. I do not know what that will make him. But it will not be anything human."

Silence fell over the pavilion. They had known their enemies were not defeated—Karishkir and Drekhlo had escaped through a portal in the bone chapel, fleeing to destinations unknown. But to learn that they were gathering allies, building strength, preparing for some terrible purpose...

"We have a decision to make," Hind said at last. "If we sail to Itil, it is a trading port, and we could make profit there. We would also be riding directly into the teeth of whatever Karishkir is planning." She paused. "If we sail to Egypt, we could trade there as well—and perhaps find answers to the mysteries that have been plaguing us. The Stygian temples, the Book of Eibon, the connections that link these things to the amulet and the fragments."

"Or," she added with a faint smile, "we can take a third option and try to ignore all that we have seen. Return to normal trade, normal routes, normal lives."

The suggestion was met with hollow laughter. None of them believed normal lives were possible anymore. They had seen too much, learned too much, been changed too profoundly by the horrors they had faced.

"Egypt," Giovanni rasped. The effort of speaking was clearly agonizing, but he forced the words out. "We must... understand... what we carry. The amulet. The fragments. If there are answers... in Egypt..."

"To Egypt, then," Hind agreed. "We sail with the morning tide."
