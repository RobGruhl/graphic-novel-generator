# Episode II: The Moon Over Merv
## Chapter Five: The Howling

Lüèduó and Bansi wandered through the alleys of Merv, coming into a square lit by lanterns where the wine shop of Arazu the Magian beckoned with warm light. The sound of shattering ceramics and the noise of a scuffle drifted from the door.

Bansi scowled. "Of course."

They wended through the shop, Bansi picking easy pockets along the way—enough to pay whatever bill Sadia had accumulated. Through the back rooms, the laughter of two women and a man rang out. Lüèduó brushed through the gauzy door hangings.

Sadia was drunk beyond belief, clearly gearing up to remove her remaining clothes. Her two companions seemed equally intoxicated. She looked up as they entered.

"Raven! Join us!"

"Oh, but another time," Lüèduó replied smoothly.

Sadia reached out, trying to pull him toward the tangle of bodies. "So glad you are here, Raven. These two don't understand me."

Bansi's voice cut through the alcoholic haze. "Hind is summoning you."

Sadia tried to stand, lurched toward Bansi, who leapt aside. The warrior woman stumbled, knocked over a table, and landed on the cushions, rolling over and laughing hysterically.

The proprietor Arazu burst through the doorway, demanding payment. Bansi paid from her recent pickpocketing with a flourish.

"Raven, my friend," Sadia slurred, embracing a nearby post, "I'm going to need some water."

It took time—and the cold shock of fountain water—to make her fit for walking.

Gan, Giovanni, and Eskil escorted Earmack through the streets of Merv to Abu-Rayhan's house. The city had grown quiet as evening deepened, the markets closing, the taverns filling with those who preferred drink to sleep.

The servant ushered them in. They removed their shoes and found Hind already there—she had taken a faster route.

Abu-Rayhan's library was piled high with scrolls and codices, chests overflowing, an astrolabe positioned by a window. Strange parchments covered the tables—star charts, Giovanni recognized.

Eskil looked around at the accumulated wealth and knowledge and remarked, "Allah is generous to his best storytellers."

Abu-Rayhan welcomed them, looking at Earmack with scholarly curiosity. "Well, it seems you've had an interesting night."

When Sadia, Bansi, and Lüèduó arrived—Sadia dumped unceremoniously in the fountain first—Hind ordered, "Get yourself together and join us in the library."

---

In the scholar's library, they retold Earmack's story. Abu-Rayhan asked after Karishkir, and the girl repeated what she had said: beautiful and terrible, a voice that hurt to hear.

"I have read of people like this," Abu-Rayhan said, his face gone pale. "A queen. Three hundred years old, according to the tales."

The walking wolves, he confirmed, were touched by strange powers. They transformed between beast and human forms.

He unrolled a scroll—a detailed drawing of the amulet, every engraving captured with precision. A sketch by Rahzalahn, he explained. He could not read the symbols himself, but spoke of someone who might be able to help.

Hind sat back, thinking. "If Earmack's tale is true, what of the ritual? What were they trying to accomplish?"

"Kurgans are the burial places of great chieftains," Abu-Rayhan said. "Perhaps they seek to raise one of the ancient dead."

Giovanni assured the others that there would be no curses, that under one God there was nothing that could hurt them. But his voice lacked conviction. He had seen the thing in the castle. He knew better than to make promises about the limits of evil.

---

Giovanni and Eskil ventured into the night market for supplies—gear for the adventure ahead, and equipment for Earmack who had arrived with nothing.

The streets were quieter now. Torchlight flickered at intervals, casting pools of illumination in the darkness.

On their way back, Eskil caught it—briefly—someone watching them. A second look revealed a person wrapped in robes and cloak, lurking in the shadows. Eskil did not betray his awareness. He continued walking, examining goods, making purchases. But his hand never strayed far from his blade.

The streets thinned out. The crowds evaporated. An occasional dog barked.

Eskil heard a growl.

He quickly turned a corner, pressing his back to the wall, blade sliding free with a whisper of steel. Giovanni melted into the shadows opposite—memories of Venice dancing across his mind—his own weapon ready.

They heard the guttural sound, and then a painful keening howl split the night, catching them off guard. Something descended from the rooftops.

A shaggy, horrible form crashed into Eskil with the force of a charging horse.

The thing attacked with savagery, landing on him, reaching with blurring speed toward his heart. The blow knocked Eskil backward, claws trying to dig into the gaps in his armor, seeking the flesh beneath.

---

Back at Abu-Rayhan's house, they all heard the howl split the night and sat bolt upright. Everyone piled back into the streets, weapons at the ready, sprinting toward the sound of the nearby conflict.

---

Eskil landed a mighty blow upon the man-beast, sending it hurtling backward. Giovanni stepped from the shadows and aimed for the beast's throat—but as he sliced at the creature, it threw him off, stumbling. The werewolf turned and whirled toward Giovanni, attempting to peel back his face. Giovanni felt the claws sweep past, missing by inches.

Eskil swung with his blade, but the beast dodged, catching his sword at the hilt and deflecting it.

Gan rounded the corner, bow drawn. She fired and just missed, the arrow whizzing past the beast's head.

Bansi hurled a dagger. The beast batted the blade away in mid-air.

Lüèduó threw his javelin. It struck the beast in the upper chest. The werewolf howled, tearing the javelin out and breaking it.

Giovanni focused everything he had. He slipped in under the creature's defenses—clearly a werewolf now, no denying what it was—and stabbed upward into its heart.

The beast staggered. Fell to its knees. Dropped to its chest. Rolled over, gurgling blood.

The fur and claws began to recede. Eskil stepped forward to cleave the head from its body. Just as his blade struck, the thing gurgled one word:

"Karishkir."

A young man's corpse lay before them, heavily tattooed, his flesh torn by their weapons. Blood pooled beneath him, black in the torchlight.

Earmack, who had followed despite her fear, confirmed it. "I recognize him. He was one of those who guarded us. But not one of the three."

They scooped up the corpse and hurried back to Abu-Rayhan's house, aware that others might be watching.

---

In the scholar's workroom, Abu-Rayhan bade them bring the body in. Earmack and Hind joined them. Earmack looked at the corpse and nodded—a lieutenant, but not the inner circle.

The eyes of the head opened.

The body began to shake and twitch, muscles spasming, the mouth working as if trying to form words. Abu-Rayhan moved with surprising speed for a scholar. He grabbed a silver-bladed dagger and plunged it into the creature's chest, uttering a prayer in Arabic.

The body shuddered once more and went still.

"Silver through the heart," Abu-Rayhan said, his voice shaking. "And prayer. It is the only way to be sure."

They stared at the corpse—truly dead now, one hoped—and contemplated what they had learned. These creatures could survive wounds that should kill. The horror of what they faced was only beginning to reveal itself.

---

They geared up. Eskil inlaid their weapons with silver purchased from the market. Naphtha—Abu-Rayhan produced flasks of the sulphurous pitch, Greek fire that would burn even on water.

Bansi raised the obvious concern. "A lieutenant nearly killed us in the streets. How are we supposed to fight their queen?"

Sadia, nursing her head from the evening's excesses, gave them a grim smile. "We either wait for them to pick us off one by one, or we seek to surprise them. Those are our choices."

Earmack voiced her fears. She did not want to go back. Could not face what waited in the darkness of the steppe. But Lüèduó spoke to her of duty and survival.

"If we do not ride out and rid the world of these beasts, your entire clan is in danger. As Gan's clan was decimated."

The words struck home. Earmack's jaw tightened, and though tears still glistened in her eyes, she nodded.

They would ride.

---

Two weeks they traveled into the desolate steppe, the oasis of Merv fading behind them until it was nothing but a memory of green. The land stretched endless and indifferent, grass rippling in winds that carried no comfort.

On the evening of the fourteenth day, Earmack called them to a halt.

"Do you see the ravine?" She pointed toward a dark gash in the land ahead. "Beyond it, a river. Ford the river and cross the plain—there is a depression where the burial mound lies."

They debated their approach. Some favored camping for the night; Sadia disagreed, feeling they should press on under cover of darkness. The argument stretched on, voices growing heated with fear and anticipation.

Then Dog's hackles rose.

The distant sound of drums reached them—a rhythmic pounding that seemed to vibrate in the bones rather than the ears. And beneath it, weaving through it, a keening howl pierced the night and their minds.

Bansi and Eskil dropped to their knees, gasping in pain.

Sadia staggered but kept her feet, drawing her weapon. Earmack fell to her knees and then her hands, blood beginning to trickle from her nose.

They heard a voice from everywhere—terrifying and beautiful all at once—calling:

*"Come to me, Earmack."*

Earmack stood in a daze, her movements jerky and puppet-like, and began to walk toward the ravine. Gan dashed forward, grabbed her, and shook her violently. Sadia joined Gan in holding Earmack back while Giovanni prayed.

Bansi and Eskil's minds were filled with visions: bloody fangs gleaming in moonlight, the moon rising above, claws and fur, human skins hanging from poles. In the midst of it all, a woman—raising her arms to the night sky.

They too cried out in pain and doubled over. Bansi's nose spurted blood.

Blood flowed from Earmack's ears and nose. She let out a scream.

Lüèduó lunged forward and slapped her, seeking to break the trance. Earmack fell to the ground dazed, blinked, and snapped out of it, her hand reaching for her blade.

Giovanni prayed for help over Bansi—and his booming voice broke into her mind, shattering the horrid visions. She gasped, finding herself on hands and knees in the grass.

But Eskil was still curled into a ball, keening in terror, lost in a vision of the mound surrounded by human skins, Karishkir in the center with a staff, a skull of some horrid creature atop it.

Giovanni prayed with all his heart. Eskil continued to moan. When words failed, Giovanni cracked his quarterstaff across Eskil's chest with force enough to leave bruises. The Norseman's eyes snapped open. He sucked in a breath that sounded like a drowning man breaking the surface.

The distant howling still lingered, but fainter now. The drums had stopped.

Gan readied her arrows, dipping them in pitch.

And from somewhere in the darkness ahead, Karishkir's voice rang out:

*"Flay them, my darlings."*

They readied themselves at the top of the ravine and waited….
