# Episode I: The Golden Road
## Chapter Three: The Amulet

They built a bonfire in the castle's courtyard, more for defense than for warmth. The wood they gathered was old and dry, and it caught quickly, sending sparks spiraling up into a sky that had gone the color of old bruises.

"One day," Bansi said, lighting a torch from the blaze. "We go in, we find what we came for, and we get out."

No one disagreed. They spat and shook hands on it—the old compact of thieves and adventurers since time immemorial.

The bonfire blazed at their backs as they entered the keep, its honest light a fragile comfort against the darkness that waited within. They moved as if entering a tomb, which perhaps they were. Giovanni prayed quietly, the Latin words a whispered thread connecting him to something beyond this forsaken place. Lüèduó wrapped silks anointed with sacred oils around his arms—a protection taught to him in lands far to the east. Abu-Rayhan murmured his own invocations. Dog pressed close to Gan's heel, hackles raised, a low whine building in his throat.

Eskil felt it before he saw it—a stabbing pain in the sigils carved onto his shoulder, his protective wards reacting to something deeply wrong. *"This place reeks of the outer dark,"* Leif's voice whispered to Eskil. *"The same stench as Eysýsla. Be wary, brother. What dwells here is kin to what took me."*

They crept through corridors that had not known living footsteps in generations, their torchlight pushing back shadows that seemed reluctant to yield. The architecture was inscrutable in ways that troubled the eye—proportions that shifted when viewed from different angles, the passages changing and rearranging out of the corner of the eye.

Despite the oddities of the place they moved ever deeper and finally reached the doors.

Bronze, or something like bronze, but the flickering torchlight revealed something deeply off with their surface. They glistened wetly, as if sweating in the cold air, and the floor before them was slick with some viscous substance that caught the light with an oily sheen.

Despite the parchment in his ears Eskil could still hear a voice, whispering at the very edge of perception, words that slithered away before the mind could grasp them.

Gan shook her head, as if clearing it of something.

Bansi moved her torch closer to the doors, and the surface *quivered*. Not a reflection, not a trick of the light. The doors themselves recoiled from the flame like living flesh from a brand.

"Burn it," Bansi said, and she and Giovanni raised their torches together.

The flame caught on the slime coating the bronze, and what followed was unlike any fire they had seen. The flames burned an unhealthy phlegm-green, spreading across the surface with hungry enthusiasm but generating almost no heat. The material beneath did not melt as metal should—it *disintegrated*, sloughing away in burning globs that hissed where they struck the floor, as if the gate were made of something organic rather than forged.

Beyond lay an inky, musty darkness that their torchlight could not penetrate.

*Better delving into the unknown than retreating to the life I fled,* Bansi thought and led them forward.

The passage beyond sloped downward, the ceiling pressing lower as they descended. Stairs appeared—ancient, worn smooth by feet that had not walked in ages beyond counting—leading straight down into the earth.

They established their order: Bansi and Giovanni first, then Lüèduó and Gan, with Abu-Rayhan and Eskil bringing up the rear. They had descended perhaps thirty steps when Abu-Rayhan's hand closed on Eskil's arm.

"A footfall," the scholar whispered. "Behind us. Someone is following."

*Nizack.* The name hung unspoken between them. Eskil set a wire trap across the stairs—a simple thing, but enough to slow pursuit—and they continued down.

At the bottom, Bansi found another set of doors, identical to the first: bronze that glistened, that seemed to breathe in the torchlight. On either side of the passage hung crow cages, their iron bars corroded with age, bones visible within—the remains of prisoners left to starve in the dark, or perhaps something worse.

They burned through the second gate as they had the first, the green flames casting writhing shadows on the walls, and emerged into a chamber that stopped them all in their tracks.

Wet, mossy vines hung from a ceiling lost in darkness above, their surfaces glistening with moisture that should not have existed in this buried place. Among the vines stood statues—or things that might have been statues—their forms unlike anything carved by human hands. They were hewn from stone of a color no quarry had ever produced, glittering with mineral inclusions that were neither gold nor fool's gold nor anything the eye could name.

And they were watching.

Not moving, not breathing, but *watching* nonetheless. Gan felt it. Eskil felt it. Even Dog felt it, cowering against his mistress's leg with a whimper he could not suppress.

Passages led off from the main chamber in several directions, black mouths promising nothing good. On the walls, writing covered every surface—but the script was nothing Abu-Rayhan recognized, nothing from any human civilization he had studied.

"This is no language of men," he breathed.

Giovanni swiped at the nearest vine with his torch, and it *retracted*, pulling back toward the ceiling like a serpent recoiling from fire.

Gan nocked an arrow, touched it to her torch, and loosed it into the center of the chamber. It struck something unseen and caught fire, and in the sudden flare of green-tinged light, they saw what waited at the far end of the room.

An altar. And behind it, a figure.

It might have been a statue, if statues could radiate such palpable malevolence. Cyclopean, massive, its single eye socket a void that drank the light. The stone from which it was carved was the same impossible material as the watching figures, and something about its proportions suggested that it was not meant to be viewed by human eyes—that the angles of its form corresponded to geometries that existed only in spaces adjacent to the world they knew.

Gan loosed a second arrow. It arced through the darkness and landed upon the altar itself, its small flame guttering but holding.

And Lüèduó began to move.

He lit the silks wrapped around his arms, and they caught with flames that burned true and golden—a small defiance against the corrupted light that filled this place. Then he danced.

It was not the dance of a performer, though it had been taught to him by performers. It was not the dance of a warrior, though it served him now as a weapon. It was something older than either—a movement of the body that traced patterns the mind could follow only imperfectly, a weaving between the hanging tendrils that seemed to confuse them, to make them reach for where he had been rather than where he was.

He whirled. He stepped. He slipped between grasping vines with inches to spare, the flames on his arms leaving trails of afterimage in the darkness, and when he reached the altar, he faced the cyclopean figure behind it and felt something vast and cold press against his thoughts.

*Join us.*

He shook it off—barely—and discarding his burning silks before they could damage his leathers he reached for the amulet that lay upon the altar's surface.

Behind him, Abu-Rayhan's voice cut through the oppressive silence: "Who is watching our backs?"

A clang rang out—metal on stone—and a weapon glanced off one of the watching statues, struck from a hand in the darkness.

"Nizack!" Eskil roared, and charged into the shadows behind them.

Everything happened at once.

Bansi heard the voices whispering in her skull, felt them trying to worm their way into her thoughts, and shook them off through sheer stubborn fury—only to hear something else. A rustling. The beat of leathery wings against stone.

She and Giovanni charged toward the altar, hacking at the tendrils that had begun descending toward Lüèduó, trying to clear a path for his retreat.

But Lüèduó could not retreat. He stood frozen, one hand still extended toward the amulet, his eyes fixed on something that had emerged from deeper in the chamber behind the cyclopean figure.

It was indescribable—genuinely, horrifically indescribable. Bird-like, but not a bird. Humanoid in the sense that it had limbs and a central mass, but alien in every proportion, wrong in every detail. It moved with clicking, chittering sounds, as if its joints were not joints at all but something else, something assembled rather than grown.

Bansi dropped to her knees, terror flooding through her like ice water in her veins. Gan stood rooted to the spot, Dog howling at her feet. Giovanni reached the altar and grabbed Lüèduó's shoulder, trying to shake him free of whatever paralysis had taken him—and then Giovanni looked up, and his hand slipped away, his own limbs going rigid as the cold evil washed over him.

The tendrils descended toward Bansi's prone form. Sadia leapt forward, her blade singing through the corrupted air, slashing at the grasping vines to keep them at bay.

And in the darkness behind them, Eskil fought Nizack.

The first warning was the crack of a whip—a sound like breaking bone that echoed off the stone walls. The leather cord wrapped around Eskil's steel collar, pulling his head down like a dog on a leash, and Nizack's weight hauled back on it, trying to bring the Norseman down.

Eskil prayed to his gods - the Aesir, the gods that asked for blood and iron rather than incense and prayer—and struck. His blade cleaved into Nizack, catching on armor, snagging, then plunging through into the soft flesh beneath. He felt the impact travel up his arm, felt the resistance of ribs parting.

Nizack grinned—a sickly, knowing smile—and lashed the whip back, striking Eskil's helm with force enough to stagger him.

Lüèduó stood at the altar, frozen, feeling the cold evil pressing against his mind like a physical weight. The amulet was inches from his fingers. The bird-thing drawing near.

He reached within himself, to the place where something ancient slumbered in his blood, and called out with everything he had.

*Please. I beg you. Whatever debt I must pay—*

The Nagini answered.

Not in words, but in sensation: thick, warm coils rising up from the earth itself, from somewhere deeper than the castle's foundations, deeper than the stone, deeper than anything that should have existed beneath this cursed ground. The coils wrapped around the bird-thing, serpentine strength constraining limbs that clicked and thrashed with fury.

*You owe me a debt,* the presence whispered in his mind. *Do not forget.*

Lüèduó grabbed the amulet and *moved*, flipping away from the altar with a grace that belied his terror, landing beside Giovanni and hauling the priest backward by his collar.

Behind them, Gan woke from her paralysis as Dog pawed frantically at her leg. She raised her bow, aimed at the struggling horror—but its gaze found her, and despite wanting to run or vomit she took one calm breath and then loosed her arrow into its face.

It screamed—a sound that would haunt her dreams for years—and the Nagini's coils tightened, dragging it back, buying them seconds they desperately needed.

Sadia's blade descended on the whip around Eskil's neck, severing it, and the Norseman drove his sword through Nizack's body in a final, desperate thrust.

Nizack howled—not a human sound, but something otherworldly, something that spoke of pacts made with powers beyond mortal understanding—and then he *vanished*, dissolving into shadow and spite, leaving only blood on the stones and the echo of his cry.

"RUN!" someone screamed.

Again they ran.

Back through the chamber with its watching statues, back through the corridor with its crow cages, back up the stairs where Eskil's wire trap lay sprung, the step bloodied. The bird-thing's shrieks pursued them, muffled by distance but never quite fading, and something about the sound suggested that the Nagini's grip would not hold forever.

They burst through the ruined keep, past the bonfire still burning in the courtyard, and Giovanni raised his crucifix toward a winged shadow that swooped low overhead. The shadow veered away—or perhaps they simply outran it—and then they were outside, under a sky that had inexplicably become the pale gold of late afternoon.

They had entered the keep at dusk. Hours had passed. Perhaps more than hours.

Time, in that place, had played tricks on them.

They did not stop to question it. They rode through the village of the dead, pausing only long enough for Lüèduó to hurl a torch onto a thatched roof, and they did not look back as flames began to climb. Through the Iron Gates they galloped, their horses foaming and staggering, riding through the night and into the next day, until finally they saw the tents of Hind's caravan spread across the plain ahead of them.

The caravan was preparing to leave. They had been given up for lost.

Hind met them as they stumbled into camp, her dark eyes taking in their haggard faces, their tattered clothes, the wild look of people who have seen things that should not exist.

"Where is Nizack?" she asked. "And where is the amulet?"

"Nizack is banished," exclaimed Father Giovanni. "He was intent on seeing us to our deaths. It's not clear who held his allegiance but it's evident that he never intended to pay anyone for anything."

Lüèduó held out his hand. The amulet lay in his palm, dark and ancient, its surface warm to the touch despite the chill of the morning air.

An old man appeared with a leather sack, its interior lined with protective symbols. He approached Lüèduó with the careful deference of someone handling materials too dangerous to treat casually.

Lüèduó dropped the amulet into the sack without ceremony.

They had found what they came for. They had survived.

But something had followed them out of that darkness. Something had marked them.

And Lüèduó, feeling the echo of serpentine coils in his memory, knew that the debt he had incurred would one day come due.

The caravan rolled through the desert at a surprisingly brisk pace. The leather sack containing the amulet slowly swung back and forth between Hind's legs with each bump of the wagon. The leather slowly blackened and burned as though from an invisible flame. The road stretched ever west toward Merv.
