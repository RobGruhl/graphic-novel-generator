# Prologue II: The Daughter of Shadows

In the high palace of Sonapura, where the Raja Kanishka ruled with an iron fist wrapped in silk, there lived a daughter who was not supposed to exist—or rather, who existed only as a chess piece to be moved when the time came. Her name was Iksha Bhima, thirteenth child of the Raja, fifth daughter, and by all rights utterly insignificant.

The palace stood in Srinagar like a jeweled crown upon the brow of Kashmir, its towers catching the first light of dawn and the last glow of sunset. Within its walls moved a world of ceremony and calculation, where every word was weighed and every gesture freighted with meaning. Here the sons learned statecraft and warfare, astronomy and mathematics, the arts of rule that had kept their bloodline in power for generations uncounted.

And here the daughters learned embroidery.

Iksha sat in the women's quarters on the morning of her ninth year, her needle moving through silk with mechanical precision while her tutors droned on about the proper way to address a visiting dignitary's wife. The air was thick with incense and the cloying scent of rose water. Around her, her sisters and half-sisters bent over their work with varying degrees of enthusiasm or resignation.

'You will be married when the time comes,' her eldest sister had told her years ago, with the weary certainty of one who had already been wed and sent away to a distant province. 'It is what we are for. The sons rule, the daughters bind alliances. That is the way of things.'

But Iksha had never been one to accept the way of things.

Through the latticed windows of the women's quarters, she could hear voices from the courtyard below—her brothers at their lessons, their tutor's voice rising in passion as he spoke of ancient battles and the constellations of the stars. She listened with an intensity that made her needle slip, drawing a bead of blood from her finger.

Her tutor noticed. 'Pay attention, Iksha. A lady does not concern herself with men's learning.'

'Why not?' The question slipped out before she could stop it.

The tutor's face hardened. 'Because it is unseemly. Because your worth lies in your beauty and your obedience, in the alliance your marriage will bring. A woman who thinks too much makes a poor wife.'

Iksha said nothing more. But that night, when the palace slept, she slipped from her chambers and made her way through corridors she had memorized during endless, boring days of being shepherded from room to room. She found the library where her brothers studied and stood in the darkness, running her fingers over scrolls that spoke of things she was forbidden to know.

It was the first of many such nights.

She became a ghost in her own home, learning the palace's rhythms as a sailor learns the sea. She discovered that the guards changed watch at predictable intervals, that certain servants were more observant than others, that if one moved with purpose and carried something—a tray, a water jug, a bundle of linens—one could go almost anywhere without question.

By her tenth year, she had perfected the art of becoming invisible. She would slip away from her lessons on the pretext of illness or women's troubles—subjects the male tutors were too embarrassed to question—and position herself in alcoves and behind screens where she could hear her brothers' education.

She learned mathematics by ear, astronomy by stolen glances at charts, history through eavesdropping on discussions of ancient campaigns. She absorbed knowledge like a desert drinks rain, greedy and grateful and terrified it would be taken away.

It was her younger brother Vikrahma who became her unlikely ally. He was closer to her age than most of her siblings, and he hated his lessons with a passion that Iksha could never understand. 'Why do I have to learn all this?' he would complain. 'I'm fifth in line. I'll never rule.'

'I'll go for you,' she offered one day, the words out before she'd fully thought them through.

He stared at her. 'What?'

'I'll disguise myself as you. Go to your lessons. You can do whatever you want—sleep, practice your archery, whatever. I'll learn, you'll be left alone, and no one will know.'

It should not have worked. But Vikrahma was small for his age, and Iksha was tall for hers, and with the right clothes and a bit of charcoal to darken her eyebrows, the resemblance was close enough. The tutors, dealing with a dozen boys at once, never looked too closely.

And so Iksha learned in earnest—not through walls and screens, but sitting among the sons of the Raja, drinking in everything they were taught. She learned to keep her head down, to answer when called upon but not so brilliantly as to draw attention, to be unremarkable in a room full of princes.

She learned warfare and strategy, the movements of the heavens, the histories of kingdoms risen and fallen. She learned in Sanskrit and Arabic, absorbed poetry alongside tactics, memorized the names of ancient heroes who had carved their legacies in blood and stone.

And she learned something else, something the tutors did not teach: that the world was larger than the palace walls, and she was meant for more than embroidery and arranged marriage.

By her twelfth year, her skills at disguise had evolved beyond simple impersonation. She befriended a dull-witted servant boy named Ravi who was responsible for running errands throughout the palace. She discovered that he was desperately lazy and terrified of being beaten for tardiness.

'I'll run your errands for you,' she offered. 'You can rest, and I'll make sure everything gets delivered on time.'

Ravi agreed with pathetic gratitude. And so Iksha, dressed in a servant's rough tunic and with her hair bound beneath a cap, began to move freely through the palace. Not as a princess, not even as a boy of noble blood, but as one of the invisible multitude who kept the great machine of state running.

She carried messages, delivered trays, hauled water and firewood. She learned the secret geography of power—which chambers connected to which, where the private stairs led, which doors were guarded and which were merely locked. She learned to pick those locks using pins stolen from her mother's chamber.

More than that, she learned the city beyond the palace walls. Ravi's errands sometimes took him into Srinagar proper, and Iksha went in his place, her heart hammering with excitement as she stepped into the narrow streets and crowded bazaars. Here was a world of merchants and beggars, of scholars and thieves, of a thousand lives lived beyond the suffocating protocols of court.

She learned the city's rhythms as she had learned the palace's—where to go, where to avoid, how to move through crowds without drawing attention. She learned the thieves' cant from street children, picked up Dogri from merchants, absorbed Bengali from traveling scholars. Languages came to her like music, each one a new way of seeing the world.

All the while, she prepared. She cached supplies in hidden corners—coins stolen a few at a time from her mother's jewelry box, clothes suitable for travel, a small knife with a blade she kept sharp. She told herself it was just precaution, just preparation for a future that might never come.

But she knew she was lying to herself. She was building an escape route. And in her thirteenth year, she would need it.

The day started like any other. She had attended her morning lessons—the real ones, in the women's quarters, where she sat with apparent docility while her mind wandered far away. In the afternoon she was scheduled to attend a calligraphy lesson, but she had already arranged with Vikrahma to take his place in a discussion of military tactics.

She was moving through the palace corridors in servant's garb, heading toward the lesson, when she heard voices from her father's private study. The door was slightly ajar—unusual, as the Raja was obsessive about privacy. She should have kept walking. Should have minded her own business.

But she heard her own name spoken in her uncle's voice, and she froze.

'The Shahi has agreed,' her uncle was saying. 'Iksha for the trade rights and military alliance. It's a good match.'

Her father's voice, dry as desert wind: 'She's thirteen.'

'The marriage will wait until she's fifteen, naturally. But the betrothal should be formalized soon. The Shahi is eager—apparently he has a fondness for young wives.'

'He's fifty-three and has six wives already.'

'Five now. One died in childbirth last month. Which is why he's looking for replacements.' A pause. 'She's your fifth daughter, Kanishka. What did you expect? The elder girls went to better matches because they were firstborn. Iksha is... surplus. We're fortunate the Shahi wants her at all.'

Iksha's hands had gone numb. The water jug she carried slipped from her fingers and shattered on the marble floor.

The conversation stopped. Footsteps approached the door.

She ran.

Not away from the study—that would have been too obvious. She ducked into a side passage, then another, putting distance between herself and the voices that were calling after the clumsy servant who had broken the jug. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Her breath came in short gasps.

Fifteen. They would wait until she was fifteen, and then they would send her away to be the sixth wife of a man older than her father. She would spend the rest of her life bearing children for a stranger, locked in another palace, her mind and spirit crushed beneath the weight of duty and submission.

No.

The word formed in her mind with perfect clarity. No. She would not go. She would not be sold like livestock, would not surrender everything she had learned and become to play the role they had written for her.

She had always known this day would come. Had prepared for it. Now the time had arrived, and she discovered that she was not afraid. There was only a cold, clear certainty.

She went first to her hidden cache in the abandoned guard tower. Retrieved the clothes, the coins, the knife. Then to the women's quarters, where she took one more thing—a small wooden flute that her mother Maya had given her years ago. It was the only thing she would take to remember the life she was leaving behind.

She changed in the servants' privy, transforming herself one final time into Ravi. The disguise was perfect—she had practiced it a hundred times. And this time, she would not be coming back.

She walked out of the palace of Sonapura in broad daylight, past guards who had seen her come and go a dozen times, past servants who knew her as one of their own. No one stopped her. No one questioned.

And as she passed through the great gates for the last time, Iksha Bhima died. What walked into the streets of Srinagar was someone new.

Bansi. The name came to her as she moved through the bazaar, already planning her next steps. It meant 'flute' in the old tongue—a fitting name for someone who would make her own music, dance to her own tune, live free of the roles others would impose.

She had coin enough for perhaps two months if she was careful. She needed to get far away, fast. The palace would search for her—she was a political asset, after all, and the Shahi would not be pleased to lose his prize. But if she could disappear into the great world beyond Kashmir, she might have a chance.

Fortune smiled on her. In the caravanserai at the edge of the city, a merchant train was preparing to depart westward—bound for Persia and beyond, a journey of months through lands she knew only from maps and stories. She approached the caravan master, a grizzled man with shrewd eyes.

'I can work,' she said, pitching her voice low and steady. 'I'm strong, I learn quick, and I don't cause trouble.'

The man looked her up and down. 'You running from something, boy?'

'Isn't everyone?' She met his gaze without flinching.

He laughed. 'True enough. You can tend the camels and help with the cooking. But if you steal or cause problems, I'll leave you in the desert. Understood?'

'Understood.'

And so Bansi joined the caravan, becoming just another face among the merchants, guards, and servants who made their living on the great trade roads. She worked hard, kept her head down, and learned everything she could about the life of constant motion.

She learned to tend camels—stubborn, ill-tempered beasts that she came to appreciate for their endurance. She learned to read the desert, to find water where others saw only sand, to navigate by stars she had once known only from scrolls. She learned the songs of the caravan folk, the stories they told around fires beneath skies so vast they made her feel both infinitely small and strangely free.

And she learned that there were others like her—people who had fled from something or toward something, who lived on the margins, who made their own rules.

It was in a city whose name she never learned, somewhere between Kashmir and the Persian Gulf, that she first encountered the Bahn-Sa-Sahn.

The thieves' guild operated out of a wine shop in the poor quarter—or so it appeared to the uninitiated. Bansi discovered it by accident, or perhaps by fate, when she was exploring the city during one of the caravan's rest stops. She had been practicing her lock-picking on a merchant's storeroom (just testing her skills) when a voice spoke from the shadows.

'Not bad technique. Little rough around the edges, but not bad.'

She spun, knife already in hand. A woman stood there—older, scarred, with eyes that missed nothing. She wore the unremarkable clothes of a dock worker, but she moved like a dancer.

'I wasn't stealing,' Bansi said.

'I know. If you were, you'd have already taken the good stuff and been gone. You're just playing. Testing yourself.' The woman tilted her head. 'You've got talent. And you're not from around here—wrong accent, wrong build. Running from something?'

'Maybe. What's it to you?'

'Nothing much. Except we're always looking for people with your particular skills. People who can blend in, who can move unseen, who aren't afraid to bend rules.' She smiled. 'Come have a drink. No obligation. Just a conversation.'

The conversation lasted three hours. By the end of it, Bansi understood what the Bahn-Sa-Sahn were—not mere cutpurses and burglars, but an organization that spanned continents, that dealt in information and influence as much as in stolen goods. They had their own code, their own honor, and they protected their members with a loyalty that put noble houses to shame.

And they wanted her.

'I'm with a caravan,' she said. 'I can't just—'

'The caravan will be here three more days. When it leaves, you can go with it or you can stay. Your choice. But if you stay, you'll have family. Protection. Training. And a mark that will identify you to any member of the guild, anywhere in the world.' The woman pulled down her collar, revealing a small tattoo on her right shoulder. 'We take care of our own.'

Bansi thought of the palace she had fled, the family that would have sold her without hesitation. She thought of the caravan, which was pleasant enough but would eventually move on without her. And she thought of what she wanted—not just freedom, but belonging. Purpose. A place where her skills would be valued rather than suppressed.

'Does it hurt?' she asked.

The woman grinned. 'Hurts like hell, but you won't forget it. And neither will we.'

The tattoo did hurt—a small symbol in ink that had been mixed with something that burned as it was worked into her skin. But Bansi bore it without flinching, and when it was done, she was no longer alone in the world.

She trained with the Bahn-Sa-Sahn for two years, learning the craft of thievery not as common crime but as art. She learned to pick any lock, to move through shadows like smoke, to disguise herself so completely that her own teachers sometimes failed to recognize her. She learned the value of information, the power of leverage, the difference between theft born of desperation and theft born of skill.

And she learned to fight—not the formal combat of soldiers, but the brutal, efficient violence of those who live on the edge. She learned the dagger intimately, learned where to strike to disable or kill, learned to read an opponent's movements and exploit every weakness.

The assignment seemed simple enough: retrieve a ledger from a merchant who had cheated the Bahn-Sa-Sahn. The guild did not tolerate those who broke contracts, and the ledger contained evidence that would ruin the man in the eyes of his trading partners.

Bansi infiltrated his compound on a moonless night, moving through shadows she had learned to wear like a second skin. The merchant was away; his guards were few and poorly positioned. She found the study without difficulty, found the ledger in a locked drawer that yielded to her picks in moments.

She should have left immediately. That was what her training demanded—acquire the target, withdraw, do not linger. But the room contained other things. A collection of statuettes carved from some greenish stone that felt odd beneath her fingers, too warm, almost pulsing. Scrolls covered in symbols that seemed to writhe at the edge of her vision. And in a glass case, something that looked like a dried piece of fruit but was not—could not be—because it had a face, withered and ancient, and as she watched, its tiny mouth opened and closed as if trying to speak.

She fled. The ledger was delivered, the contract fulfilled, and Bansi never spoke of what else she had seen in that room. But when her mentor praised her work that night, she caught something in the old woman's eyes—a knowing look, almost sympathetic.

"You've seen something," the woman said. It was not a question.

"A thing in a case. It had a face."

"Ah." The woman nodded slowly. "The merchant deals in more than silk and spices. There are those who trade in older currencies, Bansi. Things that were worshipped before the gods we know were born. You will encounter more of this as you rise in the guild. Some of our work involves... cleaning up such collections. Ensuring that certain objects do not remain in careless hands."

"What was it? The thing in the case?"

Her mentor was quiet for a long moment. "A child," she said at last. "Or what remains of one. Preserved by methods that predate alchemy, for purposes I will not name. Sleep well tonight, little one. Tomorrow, we begin your real education."

'Stay sharp,' her teacher told her. 'Stay skeptical. But don't dismiss everything as fairy tales. The world is stranger than you think, girl. And the more you see of it, the stranger it gets.'

When Bansi turned sixteen, she left the guild's home base—left, but did not leave the guild itself. Once marked, always marked. She carried their sign on her skin and their training in her bones, and wherever she went in the world, there would be others of the Bahn-Sa-Sahn who would know her as kin.

She made her way west, always west, driven by a restlessness she could not name. She worked as she traveled—sometimes as a thief, sometimes as a guard, sometimes as a merchant's agent who asked no questions about where goods came from or where they were going.

Bansi discovered that she had a gift for dangerous encounters. Where others panicked, she stayed cold. Where others froze, she moved. She could fight on a pitching deck with water up to her knees, could stand toe-to-toe with things that crawled from nightmare, could smile into the face of death and spit in its eye.

Working a trading vessel she was seventeen when they put in at a port on the coast of India, and Bansi felt something stir in her chest. Home. Not Srinagar, not the palace she had fled, but the land itself—the smells, the sounds, the cadence of voices speaking languages she had almost forgotten.

She went ashore while the ship was being reprovisioned, intending only to stretch her legs and perhaps hear news of Kashmir. But the city drew her in, pulled her through crowded streets to a temple she did not remember seeking.

The temple of Kali.

She stood before the idol—the Dark Mother with her garland of skulls, her tongue protruding, her multiple arms bearing weapons of destruction and symbols of protection. The goddess who danced on the corpses of demons, who embodied both creation and dissolution, who wore darkness like a cloak and was beautiful and terrible in equal measure.

Bansi, who had fled from one life and built another from nothing, who had danced on the edge of death a hundred times and laughed, who had rejected the soft prison of palace walls for the harsh freedom of the world—she looked at the Dark Mother and saw herself reflected.

She knelt. She did not know the proper prayers, had never been taught the rituals. But she spoke from her heart, words in Sanskrit that came to her as if from a dream.

'I am yours,' she whispered. 'Not my father's. Not any man's. Yours. If you will have me.'

She felt something then—a presence, vast and ancient and terrifying, that seemed to look directly into her soul and see every secret, every fear, every fierce joy she had ever known. And then, like a mother embracing a wayward child, it accepted her.

When she left the temple, the world looked different. Colors seemed brighter, edges sharper. She felt power thrumming through her veins, felt the blessing of the Dark Mother like a weight and a gift.

She was no longer just Bansi the thief, Bansi the caravan guard, Bansi the girl who ran away. She was Bansi the devoted of Kali, marked by darkness and bound to the goddess of destruction and liberation.

It suited her.

Now, at eighteen, Bansi moved through the world with the confidence of one who had been tested and not found wanting. She wore her armor beneath traveler's clothes, her scimitar at her hip, her collection of identities ready to be assumed at need.

She spoke five languages fluently and could get by in three more. She could pick any lock, climb any wall, become anyone she needed to be. She could fight with daggers or blade, on land or sea, against men or monsters.

She carried her wooden flute still—the last remnant of Iksha Bhima, the girl who had dreamed of freedom while sitting in palace rooms heavy with incense. She played it sometimes, in quiet moments, melodies that spoke of longing and loss and triumph.

The mark of the Bahn-Sa-Sahn on her right buttock reminded her that she had found family in unexpected places. The blessing of Kali in her heart reminded her that she was protected by powers darker and more enduring than any earthly authority.

And if sometimes she wondered what had become of her family in Srinagar—whether they had searched for her, whether they had simply written her off as lost or dead and moved on—she did not let those thoughts linger. That life was behind her, dead and buried as surely as Iksha Bhima herself.

Bansi looked only forward, to the next horizon, the next adventure, the next challenge that would test her skills and her courage. The world was vast and strange, full of wonders and horrors in equal measure, and she meant to see as much of it as she could before her time ran out.

She was a thief and a poet, a sailor and a scholar, a devotee of the Dark Mother who carried death at her hip and laughter in her heart. She was no one's daughter, no one's wife, no one's property.

She was Bansi. And she was free.

This was her story. This was her truth.
