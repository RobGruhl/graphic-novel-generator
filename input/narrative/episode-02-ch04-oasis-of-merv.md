# Episode II: The Moon Over Merv
## Chapter Four: The Oasis of Merv

The oasis of Merv spread before them like a dream of water and green after the punishing weeks of desert crossing. Palm trees swayed in the evening breeze, their fronds whispering secrets in a language older than Arabic or Persian. The great trading hub sprawled across the landscape—caravanserais and markets, mosques and temples, taverns where men of a hundred nations drank and gambled and forgot, for a time, the challenges of the road.

Hind's caravan made camp at the oasis edge, among the other merchant trains that clustered like pilgrims around a sacred spring. Cook-fires bloomed in the gathering dusk. The smell of roasting meat and exotic spices drifted on air that no longer tasted of sand and desperation.

For the first time since Samarkand, they could breathe.

Weefred, the Frankish tavern-keeper who traveled with Hind's company, set up his establishment with practiced efficiency—awnings stretched between poles, barrels tapped, cups laid out for the thirsty. His business was brisk from the moment he opened. The road bred thirst, and Merv bred opportunity.

Sadia disappeared into the town's wine shops upon arrival, drawn by the promise of revelry after too many weeks of hard travel. The others scattered to their separate pursuits, drawn by the gravity of their individual hungers.

Rahzalahn sat beneath the stars with her oud, and the music she coaxed from its strings spoke of distant shores and loves left behind. Before they had arrived, Hind had given warning to Eskil: "He who strikes at Rahzalahn, strikes at me." The Norseman had merely nodded. He understood debts, and he understood protection. Whatever lay between the oud player and their employer was not his concern.

Lüèduó found himself among the storytellers.

A circle had formed near the central fire, men and women taking turns spinning tales of adventure and wonder, of djinn in the deep desert and treasures beneath forgotten tombs. The tradition was ancient—older than Islam, older than the Silk Road itself. In the flickering light, with the stars wheeling overhead in their eternal dance, one could almost believe that the stories were true.

When his turn came, Lüèduó spoke of their recent venture. He told of the cursed castle and the village of the dead, of bronze doors that burned with green fire and statues that watched from impossible stone. He spoke of the amulet and the thing that guarded it, though he was careful to omit certain details—the Nagini's intervention, the debt he now carried.

Some things were not meant for common ears.

The listeners leaned forward, hungry for horror, and Lüèduó fed them what they craved. He had learned long ago that a well-told tale was its own kind of currency, and in the markets of the Silk Road, that currency had value.

Nearby, Bansi had joined Rahzalahn in music—playing her flute in delicate counterpoint that carried the winds of Kashmir in its undertones. She remained watchful even as she played, her eyes never quite settling. Coins landed at their feet, thrown by appreciative merchants. Bansi collected them with the casual efficiency of one who had learned on the streets that coin was survival.

Giovanni wandered the alleys of Merv alone, his robes marking him as a man of God in a city that had known many gods. He was not yet ready to engage with the temples he passed—the fire-shrines of the Zoroastrians, the mosques with their call to prayer, the older places where forgotten deities were once honored. He needed time. Time to process what they had seen in the castle. Time to reconcile his faith with the multijointed bird thing that had reached for them from the depths.

The crucifix around his neck felt heavier than usual.

At the edge of the encampment, Eskil set up his portable forge.

The work steadied him. It always had. The rhythm of hammer on metal, the hiss of hot iron in water, the transformation of raw material into something useful—these were the constants in a life that had known precious few.

Gan remained on the outskirts as well, checking on the animals, keeping watch on the horses and pack animals. Dog had relaxed somewhat since their arrival, even making friends among the caravan—Rahzalahn especially, who fed him scraps from her meals. But Dog's hackles still rose at odd moments, and Gan had learned to trust her companion's instincts.

Abu-Rayhan had a house in Merv—this surprised no one who knew the scholar. The amulet rested there now, locked away, waiting for study that none of them were eager to begin.

The vision came to Lüèduó without warning.

He had followed a dancer into a tent at the edge of the festivities—a woman whose movements had caught his eye, whose smile had promised diversions of the flesh. Such pursuits were not unusual for him. The road was long, and pleasure where one found it was a philosophy he had adopted years ago.

But when he pushed through the tent's entrance, there was a whoosh, a swirl of sparks, and suddenly he found himself somewhere else entirely.

He was staring at the Nagini.

She was beautiful in the way that a hurricane is beautiful, or the edge of a blade. Her human aspects—the face, the arms, the suggestion of breasts beneath scales of iridescent green—were merely concessions to his mortal limitations. What she truly was existed in dimensions he could not name.

*You spin pretty tales,* she said, and her voice was the rustle of scales on stone. *But you tell lies.*

"I omitted," Lüèduó replied. His voice sounded thin in this place. "There is a difference."

*Is there?* Amusement rippled through her form. *Do you think you are out of danger? You are not. The amulet is still in your midst.*

"We retrieved it. The thing in the castle—"

*Find a way to protect yourselves from that which is coming.* The Nagini's eyes—golden, slitted, ancient beyond measure—held his. *Protect yourselves. And remember: you owe me a debt for my assistance.*

The vision shattered.

Lüèduó opened his eyes, shaking off the sleep that was not quite sleep. The noises of the caravan drifted through the fabric walls. The dancer was gone—had perhaps never been there at all. His head pounded, and when he touched his face, his fingers came away slick with sweat.

*That which is coming.*

What, exactly, was coming?

The answer arrived at dusk on the following day.

Eskil sat at his tent, feeling tense. The hairs on the back of his neck prickled. He listened.

An outrider's shout shattered the evening calm.

"Rider coming!"

The music halted. People stood, hands finding weapons out of instinct. On the road from the east, a stalky horse of nomad breeding was approaching at a gallop, emerging from the gloom like a specter.

Dog began barking before anyone else reacted. Gan was on her feet instantly, running to the horse's head.

The rider—a girl, perhaps eighteen or nineteen—was astride the horse in tatters. Dusty. Bleeding. Her clothes hung in threads. She wore no boots.

Eskil shouted for the guards, snatched up his weapons, and loped into the darkness from whence the rider had come, scanning for pursuit. He found nothing—only the empty road and the settling dust of her passage. By the time he returned to the camp, Hind was already shouting for the healer.

Gan caught the girl as she slid from the saddle, helping her to a carpet spread on the ground.

"Water," the girl gasped in Turkish, her voice cracked and desperate. "Please—water—"

Gan gave her water and assessed her injuries—scrapes, cuts, bruises, the damage of hard riding and harder circumstances. Nothing that threatened her life. But whatever she had fled from, she expected it to follow.

After a few hours, with food in her belly and the worst of her terror subsided to a manageable tremor, the girl was able to sit up and speak. Hind gathered the company close in her tent, and Gan was asked to interpret.

"Who are you?" Gan asked in Turkish.

"My name is Earmack. I am of the people on the steppes." Her voice was still rough from screaming. "There were nine of us in a raiding party. The raiding was good. We rode among the kurgans—the burial mounds of the old chiefs—and they set upon us at dusk."

"Who set upon you?" Bansi asked.

Earmack's hands twisted in her lap. "People. Creatures." She used a word they struggled to understand at first, then clarified: "Walking wolves. They set upon us and captured us and tore us apart and devoured us like livestock. They took us to a great kurgan, weeks of travel, as they prepared a ceremony. We were kept in cages."

She stopped, unable to continue, fear rising in her eyes.

Bansi leaned forward. "Do you know the name Nizack?"

Earmack's head snapped up. "Where have you heard that name?"

"We've encountered him."

Giovanni blessed the girl—Gan explained that he was like a shaman—and the gesture seemed to steady her. She continued:

"They began to sacrifice us. The walking wolves—they transform. Their leader is Karishkir. She has three lovers. Nizack is one of them, a sorcerer. Drekhlo—" she pronounced it carefully, "—dragon claw. And the third, they spoke of Ahad, a great chieftain. The Khan of the Nine Skulls."

"Describe Karishkir," Abu-Rayhan said quietly.

"She was beautiful and terrible, perhaps twenty-five summers, but her voice... her voice hurts to hear. You drop to your knees and also want to flee." Earmack drew a shuddering breath. "Nizack and Drekhlo sacrificed all of my companions. I stole a horse and rode for my life. They chased me, but I outpaced them."

Silence fell over the company.

Hind stepped forward. "Gan, Giovanni, Eskil—take the girl to Abu-Rayhan's house. She will be safer there."

"Raven, Bansi—go to the wine shops and find Sadia."

Lüèduó did not entirely trust the girl—the Nagini's voice still whispered in his ear, warning of what was coming. But he nodded and rose.

Hind wrapped Earmack in a cloak of her own—a gesture of protection and kindness to someone who had suffered through something no one should.
