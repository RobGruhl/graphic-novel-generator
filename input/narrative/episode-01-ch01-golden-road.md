# Episode I: The Golden Road
## Chapter One: The Golden Road to Samarkand

The markets of Samarkand sprawled beneath a sky the color of hammered brass, a labyrinth of silk and spice where a thousand tongues haggled over goods from the uttermost ends of the earth. Here, where the great trade roads crossed like the strands of some cosmic web, one might find jade from Cathay and amber from the frozen north, carpets woven in the valleys of Persia and blades forged in the smithies of distant Frankistan. The air hung thick with incense and the cries of merchants, with the lowing of camels and the sharper notes of men who had traveled far and trusted little.

It was into this seething tide of humanity that Father Giovanni di Venezia descended, his travel-stained robes marking him as a man of God in a land where such men were curiosities at best. The dust of the Silk Road clung to him—weeks of it, accumulated through mountain passes and across windswept plateaus—and the prospect of a bath called to him with an almost physical insistence. He had coin enough for such luxuries now, and the caravanserai ahead promised at least the semblance of civilization.

He did not hear the blade clear its sheath behind him.

The sound that should have warned him—that whisper of steel against leather—was lost in the market's clamor. But something else pricked at his awareness: a face in the crowd, half-glimpsed between the swaying bolts of silk. A face he knew from Rome, from darker days and bloodier business.

Theotomere.

Giovanni lunged sideways on instinct alone, and the blade that should have opened his spine instead sang through empty air. He stumbled, caught himself against a tent pole, and spun to face his attacker.

Across the market, where she had been browsing the textile stalls with the casual patience of a predator at rest, a woman marked the commotion with sharp eyes. Bansi had come to Samarkand seeking distance from Kashmir, from the stifling expectations of wealth and the tedium of being trapped and lectured. What she had found instead was a chaos that suited her considerably better. She saw the assassin's lunge, saw the priest's desperate evasion, and kicked out at the nearest tent pole with a precision born of lightning reflexes.

The canopy came down in a billow of colored silk, but Theotomere was already moving, dancing back from the falling fabric with the ease of a man who had killed in worse conditions than these.

A blade interposed itself between the assassin and his prey—a heavy war blade, northern-forged, wielded by a man whose pale blue eyes held no particular sympathy for either party but a marked distaste for murder conducted in public spaces. Eskil had been examining a merchant's wares when the disturbance began, and had crossed the intervening distance with the unhurried certainty of a man who expected the world to accommodate his passage.

Theotomere's thrown dagger clanged off the Norseman's helm, pushing back his sackcloth hood in a shower of sparks falling away to clatter on the packed earth.

"Bastard!" Theotomere spat at Giovanni, circling, seeking an opening past this unexpected obstacle.

Giovanni's hand found his own blade—a poor thing compared to the assassin's weapon, but steel nonetheless. He lunged, the movement more desperate than skilled, and felt the tip skitter across Theotomere's guard without finding purchase.

Then another figure entered the fray: Gan, her curved blade singing through the air with the authority of the steppes behind it. The blow struck true, biting into Theotomere's side, and the assassin's eyes went wide with something that might have been surprise or might have been calculation.

He turned and vanished into the textile stalls as if he had never been, swallowed by the hanging silks and the press of bodies.

Someone in the guard began shouting—the universal sound of authority arriving too late to be useful—and suddenly the prospect of explaining this incident to Samarkand's magistrates seemed considerably less appealing than the bath Giovanni had been contemplating.

"With me!" A woman's voice cut through the confusion, sharp and certain. She stood at the mouth of an alley, her hand on a sword-hilt worn smooth with use. Bracers gleamed on her forearms, and everything about her—the set of her shoulders, the way her eyes never stopped moving—spoke of someone who knew the better end of a blade. "With me, fools, or do you prefer the dungeon?"

They ran.

Through the gates they plunged, out of the city proper and into the sprawling encampment of a caravan that seemed to have sprung from the desert itself. Cook-fires flickered in the gathering dusk. Somewhere, drums throbbed a rhythm that spoke of distant lands. A fire-swallower practiced his art before a cluster of wide-eyed children, and robed monks moved through the crowd like ghosts in brown wool.

The warrior woman—Sadia, as they would come to learn—turned on her heel and regarded them with an appraising eye.

"Seems like you can all handle yourselves," she observed. "Would you like me to introduce you to someone who can employ you?"

There was some confusion over Giovanni's dialect—his Arabic twinged with the accent of a Mediterranean merchant—but Sadia merely shrugged and led them deeper into the encampment. The dog that had been trailing Gan pressed close to her heel, hackles not quite raised but watchful nonetheless.

Two armed men flanked the entrance to a giant tent that stood somewhat apart from the others, its fabric richer, its guy-ropes strung with small bells that chimed softly in the evening breeze. They dropped their weapons at the guards' silent insistence. Gan motioned to her dog to be ready, but complied. Bansi *dropped* rather more weapons than seemed entirely possible for one person to have been carrying. Eskil's blade was so heavy that the guard stumbled as he tried to wrestle it into a rack beside the entrance.

Inside, incense hung thick enough to taste. A young woman sat in one corner, pretty in the way of flowers that bloom in harsh climates, her fingers moving over the strings of an oud. A scruffy man bent over maps spread across a low table. And in the place of command, seated on cushions with the ease of one born to authority, waited a woman whose jet-black eyes missed nothing.

She appeared unarmed but weapons were not what made her dangerous. Her air of command almost palpable.

"Greetings," she said. "I am Hind. Who might you be?"

They gave their names and their stories, or at least the portions of their stories they wished to share. Bansi of Kashmir, who had risen from the streets. Lüèduó, who had emerged from the desert with secrets written in his silence. Eskil, who named himself a servant of guild executioners and thrust his hands out palms up when the oud player—Rahzalahn—stopped playing at the mention of his Norse origins.

"My lady, he is a Norseman!" Rahzalahn's voice trembled with old grief. "His people destroyed mine."

Hind held up a hand, and the tension subsided—not vanishing, but retreating to a manageable distance. "Are you a Varangian?"

Eskil's voice was calm, almost gentle, pleading, "There are many tribes. Excuse bad memories."

Giovanni introduced himself as a priest of the Christian god—"the god of Arabs and Jews also"—and watched the reactions flicker across the assembled faces. Gan spoke of seeking a new family, hers having been hunted and destroyed. The oud player's fingers had gone still on the strings.

Abu-Rayhan, the scruffy scholar with the maps, studied them with the peculiar intensity of a man who collected knowledge the way others collected coins. Sadia stood silent by the entrance, her hand never far from her blade.

---

Several days of preparation passed slowly, each member of the company finding their own way to occupy the hours before departure.

It was Giovanni who caught her.

Bansi had been careful—she was always careful—but the priest had an instinct for deception that she had underestimated. He found her in Hind's supply tent, her hands buried in a chest of coins, her expression the perfect mask of innocent confusion.

"I was looking for—"

"You were stealing." Giovanni's voice was mild, almost conversational, but his eyes were hard. "From the woman who pays our wages. From the caravan that shelters us."

"I was *borrowing*. I intended to return it."

"With interest, I'm sure."

Bansi weighed her options. She could lie—claim she'd been checking the inventory, testing the security, anything plausible—but something in the priest's gaze suggested he would see through whatever story she constructed. Instead, she withdrew her hands from the chest, empty, and met his eyes directly.

"Old habits," she said. "I've been on my own a long time, Father. When you're alone, you take what you can, when you can, because you never know when the next meal is coming."

"You are not alone now."

"No?" She gestured at the tent around them—at the caravan, the strangers, the road that stretched in every direction toward unknown dangers. "I've known these people for days. Days. That's not enough to trust. That's barely enough to learn names."

Giovanni considered this. Then, to her surprise, he sat down on a nearby crate, his posture relaxing. "You're right. It isn't enough. But trust has to begin somewhere, doesn't it? Someone has to take the first step."

"Easy for you to say. You've got your god looking out for you."

"My god has a complicated relationship with those who rely on Him for protection. Ask the martyrs." A ghost of a smile crossed his face. "I didn't always wear these robes, you know. Before I was a priest, I was a merchant. Before I was a merchant, I was a farm boy who watched his father get cheated by men in fine clothes. I understand what it means to be powerless. To take what you can because no one will give you anything."

Bansi's eyes narrowed. "And now you're going to tell me about redemption? About the healing power of faith?"

"God, no. I was going to tell you that if you want to steal from Hind, you should at least be better at it. She has guards who check this tent hourly. You would have been caught regardless of my intervention."

There was a long pause. Then Bansi laughed—a genuine sound, surprised out of her. "You're not what I expected, priest."

"I rarely am." Giovanni stood, brushed off his robes, and moved toward the tent's entrance. "I won't tell Hind. This time. But if you steal from our people again—from *any* of our people—I will be considerably less understanding. We're going to need to trust each other before this journey ends. You might want to start practicing."

He left her there, alone with the chest of coins she no longer wanted.

That night, around the fire, Bansi found herself sitting closer to the others than she had before. Not quite among them—old habits died hard—but no longer quite so separate.

It was, perhaps, a beginning.

---

The confrontation with Eskil came on the third night, when the wine had been flowing freely and guards were loosened along with tongues.

Rahzalahn had been playing—soft melodies from her homeland, songs that spoke of shores she would never see again—when Eskil walked past. She stopped mid-note, her fingers frozen on the strings, and her eyes followed him with an intensity that made the air around her seem to crystallize.

"You," she said. The word was quiet, but it carried.

Eskil turned. He had heard that tone before, in the voices of those who had lost everything to his people. "Yes?"

"I know what you are. *Varangian.*" She spat the word like a curse. "Your people burned my village when I was seven years old. They took my mother. They took my sisters. They left nothing but ashes and corpses and me, hiding in a fishing boat beneath the docks."

The campfire had gone quiet. Giovanni rose from his seat, ready to intervene, but Bansi caught his arm—*wait*, the gesture said. *Let this play out.*

Eskil stood motionless, his face unreadable. "I am sorry for your suffering."

"Sorry?" Rahzalahn laughed—a sound like breaking glass. "You are *sorry*? Your people do not know the meaning of the word. You raid and burn and rape and move on, and you call it glory. You sing songs about the villages you destroy."

"I do not sing such songs."

"No? Then what do you sing, Norseman? What melodies comfort you when the screams of the dying echo in your ears?"

Eskil was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was lower than before, rougher. "I sing of home. Of forests and mountains and the cold sea. Of a brother I will never see again. Of a life that was taken from me by forces you cannot imagine." He raised his hands—palms up, the gesture of surrender he had made when first meeting Hind. "I have done terrible things, musician. Not to your people, but to others. I do not ask your forgiveness. I do not deserve it. But I am not your enemy. Not tonight. Not on this road."

Rahzalahn's fingers tightened on her oud until the knuckles went white. For a moment, violence trembled in the air between them.

Then Lüèduó spoke from the shadows where he had been watching. "The Norseman speaks truth, for what it is worth. I have known raiders and reavers. I have known men who glory in destruction. He is not one of them." A pause. "Also, if you damage that oud in a fit of passion, I will be deeply disappointed. It has a lovely tone."

The absurdity of the comment broke something in the tension. Rahzalahn stared at Lüèduó, then at Eskil, then back at the serpent-blooded dancer.

"You are all mad," she said finally. "Every one of you."

"Almost certainly," Giovanni agreed. "But we are mad together, which is better than being mad alone. Come, sit. Let me tell you about the time I accidentally blessed a donkey in Constantinople. It involves considerably more chaos than you might expect."

Rahzalahn did not sit. But she did not leave, either. And when she resumed playing, some minutes later, her music had changed—still melancholy, still weighted with loss, but no longer quite so sharp.

Eskil remained standing at the edge of the firelight for a long while, watching the stars wheel overhead in their eternal dance, before he finally retreated to his tent.

The wound between them was not healed. Perhaps it never would be. But it had been acknowledged, and that was a beginning.

---

In the morning Hind summoned them. She nodded slowly, as if confirming something she had already suspected. "Four barbarians, a scholar, and a priest. An unusual company." Her gaze swept across them. "I have a job for you."

Sadia stepped out and returned with another figure: a local nobleman whose name was Nizack, whose smile did not quite reach his eyes.

"Three days' ride to the Iron Gates," Hind explained, "and then one turns into the desert hills. There is a ruined castle there, and within it an amulet set with a jewel from the days of the ancients. The villagers say the castle is cursed."

She let the word hang in the incense-thick air.

"If you help Nizack retrieve it, I will help you sell whatever other treasures you might find there."

Giovanni considered. The others exchanged glances—the wordless communication of people who have not yet learned to trust one another but recognize the shape of necessity when they see it.

"A longer contract might be discussed," Hind added, "depending on how this venture concludes."
