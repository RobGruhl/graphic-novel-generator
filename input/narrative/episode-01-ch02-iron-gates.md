# Episode I: The Golden Road
## Chapter Two: The Iron Gates

Three days they rode through lands that shifted from the cultivated valleys around Samarkand to something older and wilder. Sadia accompanied them, her silence a comfortable presence that required no filling. Nizack spoke little, and when he did, his words carried the careful weight of a man who measured everything he said against some private calculus.

Dog did not like Lüèduó.

This was, Gan reflected, not entirely unreasonable. Animals often sensed things that humans could not, and whatever the dancer from Cathay truly was, he was not entirely human. Dog's hackles rose whenever Lüèduó came near, and the low growl that rumbled in his throat spoke of ancient enmities—wolf and serpent, predator and prey, relationships older than humanity itself.

The confrontation came on the second night when Lüèduó, returning from a late-night stroll through the camp, passed too close to where Dog lay sleeping.

The animal exploded from rest to attack in a single heartbeat, jaws snapping toward the dancer's throat. Lüèduó twisted aside with inhuman grace—his body seeming to flow like water around the attack—and suddenly Dog was pinned beneath him, the dancer's hand pressed against the animal's skull, their eyes locked in a contest of wills.

"*Stop*," Lüèduó said, and there was something in his voice that was not quite human—harmonics that vibrated at frequencies that made Gan's teeth ache.

Dog went still. Not calm—his body still trembled with the urge to fight—but still, as if frozen by a force greater than his own instincts.

Gan had her bow drawn before she consciously decided to act. "Release him."

"I am not harming him. I am... communicating." Lüèduó's eyes never left the animal's. "Your companion sees what I am. What I truly am. He reacts as any predator would—with aggression, with the need to establish dominance. But I am not his enemy. I am not *your* enemy. I am simply... other."

"What are you?"

The question hung in the air. Around them, the camp had gone quiet—others awakened by Dog's bark, watching from tent-flaps and around cook-fires, pretending not to see what was happening but unable to look away.

Lüèduó smiled, and for just a moment, in the flickering firelight, his teeth seemed too long, too sharp. "I am a dancer. A spy. A gambler who cannot resist the call of the dice. I am a man who carries something in his blood that is older than the empires we travel through." He released Dog, rising in a single fluid motion. "I am also very tired, and would prefer to sleep rather than explain my lineage to everyone in this caravan. Can we perhaps save the interrogation for morning?"

Dog scrambled to his feet and retreated to Gan's side, still growling but no longer attacking. Gan lowered her bow but did not unstring it.

"If you hurt him—"

"I have no intention of hurting anyone who does not try to hurt me first. Your companion is safe." Lüèduó paused at the entrance to his tent. "But you might want to keep him close when we travel. There are things on the road ahead that would see him as prey rather than partner. I, at least, recognize his value."

He disappeared into his tent, leaving Gan alone with Dog and the weight of questions she was not certain she wanted answered.

"Strange company we've fallen in with," she murmured, scratching behind Dog's ears. The animal whined softly, pressing against her legs.

From somewhere in the darkness, she could have sworn she heard Eskil's voice—low, amused, speaking to no one she could see: "We are *all* strange company, *siostra*. That is why together we fit so well."

She did not sleep restfully that night. But when morning came, she found herself watching Lüèduó with new eyes—not with fear, exactly, but with the wary respect one predator affords another.

It was, she supposed, a kind of understanding.

On the third evening, as the sun bled crimson across the horizon, they made camp within sight of the Iron Gates—that ancient boundary where the settled lands gave way to the domain of the nomads. The transition was visible even in the quality of the light: beyond those weathered pillars, the world took on a different character entirely.

They gathered around the fire, these strangers bound by circumstance and the promise of gold.

"Among my people," Lüèduó said, breaking a silence that had grown comfortable, "there is a tradition of speaking stories when the coals burn low. Of where we come from. Of what we seek."

Abu-Rayhan nodded slowly. "A good tradition. The sharing of tales builds trust."

And so they spoke, each in turn, of tribes that had vanished and families that had scattered, of knowledge that burned to be shared and pasts that ached to be escaped. Eskil offered to repair their weapons—a practical gesture that spoke louder than any oath. Father Giovanni shook his head "I find myself a stranger in strange lands. Despite my letters and learning, most of the world considers me a barbarian still. A barbarian I may be for I am no stranger to violence." His hands quickly shifted and checked his weapons.

Bansi and Sadia took the first watch.

The fire had burned to dark embers when Dog lifted his head, ears pricked toward something in the darkness beyond the camp's edge. Gan's hand found her bow without conscious thought.

An arrow whistled out of the night and struck the saddle where Giovanni's head had been resting moments before.

"Enemies!" Sadia's shout split the silence as bandits charged out of the darkness, blades gleaming in the dying firelight.

What followed was brief and brutal. Sadia's sword found one man's chest before he had taken three steps, the body crashing into the fire and scattering embers across the packed earth. Lüèduó snatched up a javelin and hurled it at a charging figure, but the bandit dodged with the desperate agility of the doomed. Giovanni's dagger found its mark in the shoulder blades of an attacker—not a killing blow, but enough to send the man staggering.

Bansi's blade opened another from hip to shoulder.

Gan's arrow took one in the leg, and Dog was on him before he could recover, teeth finding the arm that held the sword.

And then Eskil emerged from his tent.

He came out roaring something in the tongue of the north, his war-blade already in motion. All muscles and scars, his skin bright red, runes carved and painted across his frame. The stroke that followed was not so much a swing as a butchering—the kind of blow that spoke of years spent learning exactly how much force was required to cleave a man in two.

The remaining bandits fled into the darkness, their courage broken by that single, terrible display.

Sadia pulled her blade free from the man she had killed and, after a moment's consideration, offered it to Eskil for sharpening. It was, in its way, an honor.

The iron skull at his belt whispered: *"You fought well, brother. But you revealed too much. They will remember the bellowing Norseman when subtlety might have served better."*

Eskil's hand briefly touched the skull in acknowledgment, but he said nothing aloud.

Two days more brought them to the village that lay in the shadow of the cursed castle.

The devastation announced itself before they ever reached the first house. Fields lay fallow, crops rotting in the furrows. A well stood open and unattended at the village's edge. No smoke rose from any chimney, no children played in the dusty streets, no dogs barked at their approach.

Silence hung over everything like a shroud.

Lüèduó heard it first—a tremor in Nizack's voice as their guide offered some innocuous observation about the village's layout. The words themselves meant nothing; it was the quality of falseness beneath them that set Lüèduó's instincts screaming.

"We are about to be attacked," Lüèduó whispered to Bansi.

The warning rippled through the group in hushed tones, but before they could properly prepare, Nizack had slipped away into the mist that was beginning to curl through the abandoned streets.

"Traitor!" Abu-Rayhan's curse echoed off empty walls.

Gan released her falcon, and the great bird took to wing, circling once before settling on the rim of the village well. Bansi approached it cautiously and peered down into the darkness.

Corpses. The well was choked with corpses.

They split up to search—Giovanni, Gan, and Lüèduó in one direction; Abu-Rayhan, Bansi, and Eskil in the other. Both groups found the same tableau of horror: doors hanging open, food cold in cooking pots, the detritus of lives interrupted mid-motion.

In the fire temple, Bansi found a desiccated hand reaching out from beneath a fallen beam. She signaled to Eskil, who had gone suddenly still, one hand pressed to his chest where the protective sigils were carved into his flesh.

"The village is cursed," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "We should leave."

But leaving was no longer an option.

Dog barked once, sharp and urgent, and Giovanni turned to find a villager standing not three feet away. The figure was desiccated, dried out like leather left too long in the sun, but it was *standing*. And its hands were reaching for his throat.

The grip, when it closed around his neck, was cold as winter ice.

Giovanni struggled, his vision already beginning to darken, but the thing's strength was beyond anything human. Then Sadia was there, her blade singing through the corrupted air, and the creature's head tumbled from its shoulders as Dog leapt upon the body and bore it to the ground.

All around them, more figures were rising—corpses dragging themselves upright. The whispers from the corpses slowly gained in volume, becoming an insistent chorus of rasping calls.

*Join us. Come to us.*

Abu-Rayhan counseled everyone not to listen. Eskil carved a rune in his palm and an identical rune on the iron skull at his belt glowed furnace red, as blood dripped from his hand. The zombies were covered in shadowy green witchfire, marking them against the mist.

"Ghouls!" Abu-Rayhan's voice cracked with recognition. "In my country we call these ghouls! Do not let them bite you!"

Eskil took Abu-Rayhan's warning literally against the cries that should not be heard and placed two wads of chewed parchment into his ears.

They fought their way toward the castle that loomed above the village, its ruined walls offering at least the promise of defensible ground. Lüèduó set fire to one of the corpses as they ran, and the flames spread with unnatural eagerness, as if their dry corpse skin welcomed the addition of honest flame.

"To the castle!" Abu-Rayhan shouted. "The castle is our only chance!"

Through the mist they fled, boulders and debris cluttering their path, the shambling dead close behind. At the base of the slope leading up to the castle gates, Abu-Rayhan called a halt.

"Listen," he gasped. "Do not let them bite you. And do not listen to the voices."

Sadia slapped her blade against her palm in a rhythm that seemed to steady her nerves. They lit torches and began the ascent.

Bansi caught a sound ahead—a rustling, like the beat of leathery wings against stone. Behind them, on the slopes below, ghastly luminescent eyes were climbing upward, dozens of them, a constellation of hunger.

*Join us. Come to us.*

"Push the boulders!" Lüèduó said to Eskil. Eskil strained and pushed against the largest stone, shoulders bulging, feet planted, groaning, as the plinth barely shifted, but Sadia and Gan added their efforts to his, and soon the massive stone went crashing down the trail. The sound of impacts, of shattering bone and rupturing flesh, rose from below, but they did not stop to count the fallen.

The gate was rusted but intact. Gan swung at the lowering mechanism, and the portcullis dropped with a crash that seemed to shake the very stones.

Giovanni scrambled up to the battlements, crucifix in hand, and looked down at the horde below. The ghouls stared up at him with eyes like poisoned stars.

"*In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...*"

The lights in those terrible eyes flickered and died as the last rites rolled over them, and their bodies fell back from the walls, breaking apart as they tumbled down the slope.

The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of blood and bronze.
